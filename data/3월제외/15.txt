19. 다음 글에 드러난 Gabby의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Stepping up to the microphone, Gabby could feel the sweat
starting to run down her face and neck. She tried to take a deep
breath, but couldn’t. As her name was called, Gabby became
more afraid of speaking before a large audience. Then, she
suddenly remembered the words of a woman who had gradually
overcome the same fear: “Fear, rapid heartbeat, quick breathing,
and sweating are simply the body’s declaration that we are ready
to fight.” Recalling this, Gabby calmed down and remembered
clearly what she had to say. Assured, Gabby smiled and started
to deliver her speech. The words flowed out like water, and
her beating heart gave her more and more mental strength.
The performance was successful. She had overcome her fear.
(1) hopeful → scared (2) indifferent → refreshed
(3) jealous → delighted (4) anxious → confused
(5) worried → confident
20. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Planning involves only the half of your brain that controls
your logical thinking. The other intuitive half of your brain
is left out of this planning process. If you insist on always
having a plan, you cut yourself off from your intuitive self
and the inner joy it provides. To break planning addiction,
allow yourself one freedom. Decide to spend a day exploring
a park or a neighborhood with curiosity as your only guide.
The next time you feel attracted to someone, and want to
introduce yourself, go ahead. You’ll be likely to make a new
friend. By giving yourself freedom to follow your intuition,
you develop your sensitivity to your inner voice. You learn to
hear the quiet messages that can make your life an adventure.
(1) 내면의 즐거움을 얻기 위해 친구를 많이 사귀어라.
(2) 학습 계획을 수립할 때는 시간 배분을 적절히 해라.
(3) 사고력 향상을 위해 가능한 한 산책 시간을 늘려라.
(4) 새로운 모험을 시작하기 전에 주변 사람들과 상의해라.
(5) 계획 수립에 얽매이지만 말고 때로는 직관에 따라 행동해라.

21. Although the Internet seems truly global these days,
less than half of the world’s population has access to
it. Some four billion people are still unconnected. This
spring, IT engineers will begin to shift to the next phase
in a grand plan to bring the Internet to everyone. Their
goal is to establish a network of high-altitude balloons
that will rain 4G LTE signals down to anyone with a
4G device. Regional telecom companies will transmit the
signals to the balloons, and then each balloon will relay
the signals to a ground area many miles in diameter. In
this way, farmers in remote areas will be able to access
weather data, and rural children will be able to pursue
online educations. By the end of the year, the engineers
aim to have 100 balloons about 13 miles up.

22. Inflation can be a major life concern for most people.
It makes it difficult for households to plan ahead. This is
because ‘future problems’ concerning inflation often make
us change our plans for the future. For instance, how
much should the parents of a newborn start regularly
saving to pay for her college education? If inflation
averages two percent, prices roughly double every thirty-six
years. But if inflation gets up to eight percent, prices
roughly double every nine years. A Harvard education
that currently costs $100,000 may therefore end up costing
half a million dollars for an infant born today. Millions
of workers who retired with pensions during the 1960s
and 1970s found that inflation pushed up costs far beyond
their expected expenses. Many had to reenter the workforce
just to make ends meet.

23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
Tourism is important for more than just vacationing.
Tourism allows people from different places and cultures
to come together, and then tourists and host communities
learn about each other’s differences and similarities. They
also learn new tastes and ways of thinking, which may
lead to a better understanding between hosts and tourists.
Another positive effect of tourism is the aid it provides
for the survival of a society’s culture, especially the
culture’s art forms. The opportunity to sell native artworks
to tourists or perform folk dances for them may encourage
local artists to preserve traditional art forms. For example,
Fijians have developed their palm mat and shell jewelry
crafts into profitable tourist businesses. They also earn
additional income by performing folk dances and fire
walking.

25. 교황 Julius Ⅱ의 무덤에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지
않는 것은?
The project of creating the tomb of Pope Julius Ⅱ was
originally given to Michelangelo in 1505, but the tomb
was not completed until 1545. It was designed by
Michelangelo himself as the pope requested. The design
called for some 40 statues, and the tomb was to be a
giant structure. Just less than a year after the initial work
on the tomb began, it stopped because of lack of funds.
When Pope Julius Ⅱ died in 1513, he left money for the
completion of his tomb, so Michelangelo started work
again. After some years of carving, he completed Moses,
one of the most famous statues of the tomb. However,
the next pope, Leo X, had little interest in continuing the
project. As time went on, its scale was reduced, and the
project for the tomb was revised again and again.
(1) Michelangelo가 디자인했다.
(2) 자금 부족으로 작업이 중단된 적이 있다.
(3) Moses는 무덤의 가장 유명한 조각상 중 하나이다.
(4) 교황 Leo X는 프로젝트를 지속하는 것에 관심이 많았다.
(5) 프로젝트는 여러 차례 수정되었다.

An independent artist is probably the one (1) who lives
closest to an unbounded creative situation. Many artists
have considerable freedom from external requirements
about what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and why.
At the same time, however, we know that artists usually
limit themselves quite (2) forcefully by choice of material
and form of expression. To make the choice to express a
feeling by carving a specific form from a rock, without
the use of high technology or colors, (3) restricting the
artist significantly. Such choices are not made to limit
creativity, but rather to cultivate (4) it. When everything is
possible, creativity has no tension. Creativity is strange in
that it finds its way in any kind of situation, no matter
how restricted, just as the same amount of water flows
faster and stronger through a narrow strait (5) than across
the open sea.

The desert locust lives in two remarkably different
styles depending on the availability of food sources and
the density of the local locust population. When food is
scarce, as it usually is in their native desert habitat,
locusts are born with coloring designed for camouflage
and lead (A) solitary / social lives. But when rare periods
of significant rain produce major vegetation growth,
everything changes. At first, the locusts continue to be
loners, just feasting off the (B) insufficient / abundant
food supply. But as the extra vegetation starts to die
off, the locusts find themselves crowded together.
Suddenly, baby locusts are born with bright colors and a
preference for company. Instead of avoiding one another
and hiding from predators through camouflage and
inactivity, these locusts gather in vast groups, feed
together, and (C) overwhelm / overestimate their predators
simply through numbers.

Ellie walked to school in her new shoes. “I like those,”
Megan whispered. “Cool.” Ellie felt happy. (1) She knew
it was hard to get compliments from Megan and couldn’t
hide her smile. The two friends had desks side by side at
the back. “Stop talking, you two,” said Miss Smith.
“Bring your books to me if you’ve finished.” Ellie
followed Megan to the front of the class. (2) She always
let Megan go first. She felt scared when Miss Smith
was upset. Miss Smith noticed (3) her new shoes. “Those
aren’t suitable for school,” she said, her voice cold. Ellie
took a deep breath. “The shop didn’t have black shoes,
Miss Smith,” (4) she said. Her voice came out in a

please. On Monday.” (5) She used her quiet-shout voice

31. In an increasingly globalized world, literature in
translation has an especially important role. Increasingly,
writers, readers, and publishers are turning to literature as
a bridge between cultures, particularly Western and Arab
societies. This growing interest is, in turn, driving a
boom in translation. However, not surprisingly perhaps,
most translations are from English into other languages,
not from another language, such as Arabic, into English.
Hence, the huge American market is seen as driving the
. Bookstores in the United States, for example,
rarely stock more than Nobel Prize winner Naguib
Mahfouz’s Cairo Trilogy, a masterful, realistic account of
life in Cairo and of a merchant family in the mid-20th
century. Western readers likely know little of Mahfouz’s
more experimental work, his political and religious
allegories, or his historical dramas. The result is a kind
of one-way mirror between America and the rest of the
world. [3점]

32. We tend to assume that the way to get more time is
to speed up. But speeding up can actually slow us down.
Anyone who has ever rushed out of the house only to
realize that their keys and wallet are sitting on the
kitchen table knows this only too well. And it’s not just our
efficiency that is reduced. The quality of the experience
suffers too, as we become less aware or ‘mindful.’ Have
you ever eaten an entire meal without tasting any of it?
Hurrying up doesn’t just give us less time, it can also
steal the pleasure and benefit from the time that we do
have. For many of us, hurrying is a way of life. Some
of us enjoy the thrill that it gives us while others are
driven crazy by the constant pressure and feel that their
lives are speeding up to an unacceptable degree. Either
way, there are almost certainly areas of our life that
could be . [3점]

33. The audience receives a sound signal entirely through
the vibrations generated in the air, whereas in a singer
some of the auditory stimulus is conducted to the ear
through the singer’s own bones. Since these two ways of
transferring sound have quite different relative efficiencies
at various frequencies, the overall quality of the sound
will be quite different. You have probably experienced this
when you have listened to your own voice, as on tape or
through a public address system. It is easy to blame the
‘sound of a stranger’ on ‘poor electronics,’ but this is
only partly justified. The major effect comes from the fact
that you hear yourself differently from the way others hear
you. This is one of the main reasons why even the most
accomplished singers have to listen to the opinion of
coaches and voice teachers as to ‘how they sound,’ whereas
no concert violinist would have to do such a thing. To the

Problems can be distinguished according to whether
they are reasonable or unreasonable. Reasonable problems
are of the kind that can be solved in a step-by-step
manner. A crossword puzzle is of this nature. Given a
sufficient vocabulary, the empty spaces can be filled in
one by one. Unreasonable problems, (A) , cannot be
treated this way because the task contains some ‘trick’ or
‘catch’ that must be understood before someone can
arrive at a solution. This feature frustrates any step-by-step
process that proceeds without the realization that “things

School physical education programs should offer a
balanced variety of activities that allow young people to
develop ability in lifetime activities that are personally
meaningful and enjoyable. A balance should exist in
any physical education program among team, dual,
and individual (lifetime) sports. (1) Team sports such as
basketball and soccer provide an opportunity for students
to develop skills and to enjoy working and competing
together as a team. (2) However, in many school physical
education programs, team sports dominate the curriculum
at the expense of various individual and dual sports, like
tennis, swimming, badminton, and golf. (3) In such cases,
the students lose the opportunity to develop skills in
activities that they can participate in throughout their

Cultural characteristics are not only passed from
parents to children, but may be passed on from any one
individual to another by word of mouth or by writing.
(A) Like those infectious diseases, cultural habits such as
pop music preferences and clothing fashions may
spread very quickly nowadays, especially through the
media of radio and television.
(B) So some cultural changes may be adopted quite
quickly by a whole population. Transmission of
culture is rather like transmission of an infection. Flu
and colds spread very quickly, especially with the
large amount of contact that people now have with
each other.
(C) However, other deep-rooted cultural characteristics of
races and racial subgroups are much more difficult to
change. These are the cultural patterns that are so

The timing of positive versus negative behavior seems
to influence attraction. Several studies have identified
what has been called the loss-gain effect.
(A) Studies suggest that you would not. In fact, people
are more attracted to individuals who are consistently
negative than to people who initially behave positively
and then switch to negative behavior.
(B) The reason is this: people who start out being nice
get our hopes up, so the letdown we experience
when we discover that they are not nice makes it
worse than if they had acted badly from the start.
(C) This effect reflects what happens to attraction when a
person’s behavior moves from positive to negative or
from negative to positive. For example, if someone
seemed very nice to you early in the interaction, but
then began to act like a fool, would you be more
attracted to that person than if that person were a
fool from the start?

The spoonful of 95℃ soup hitting your foot hurts, but
not as badly as it would if you accidentally spilled the
entire pot of 95℃ soup on your foot.
Heat and temperature are two quantities that can be
easily confused. Imagine cooking a very large pot of
chicken soup on the stove. Let’s suppose you heat the
soup until it is 95℃, quite hot. ( (1) ) You grab a spoon
and take out a spoonful of soup to taste. ( (2) ) As you
remove the spoonful of soup from the pot, it has the
same temperature as the larger sample. ( (3) ) Unfortunately,
as you bring the soup towards your mouth to taste it, the
spoon slips from your hand, pouring its contents on your
bare foot. ( (4) ) If both the spoonful and the pot full of
soup have the same temperature, why would the larger
sample cause more damage if it came in contact with
your skin? ( (5) ) The answer to the question lies in the
difference between temperature and heat.

They quickly pick out a whole series of items of the
same type, making a handful of, say, small screws.
People make extensive use of searching images. One
unexpected context is sorting. Suppose you have a bag of
small hardware ― screws, nails, and so on ― and you
decide to organize them into little jars. You dump the
stuff out on a table and begin separating the items into
coherent groups. ( (1) ) It is possible to do this by
randomly picking up individual objects, one by one,
identifying each one, and then moving it to the
appropriate jar. ( (2) ) But what most people do is very
different. ( (3) ) They put them in the jar and then go
back and do the same for a different kind of item. ( (4) )
So the sorting sequence is nonrandom, producing runs of
items of a single type. ( (5) ) It is a faster, more
efficient technique, and much of the increased efficiency
is due to the use of searching images. [3점]

There are two types of managers in business
organizations: functional managers and project managers.
Both types of managers have different roles and
qualities. Functional managers head one of a firm’s
departments such as marketing or engineering, and they
are specialists in the area they manage. They are skilled
at breaking the components of a system into smaller
elements, knowing something of the details of each
operation for which they are responsible. On the other
hand, project managers begin their career as specialists
in some field. When promoted to the position of project

It isn’t going to be easy making changes to the food
your children eat, and even the most careful, patient
parents will probably find that the little ones will resist
at some point and to some degree. The problem is that
many of us were forced to eat in a healthy way as
children: we learned the hard way. And the temptation
to continue with these parental habits with our own
children is strong.
If you were made to sit at the table until you had
cleaned your plate, you are not alone: most of the adult
population have suffered this at some point ― at school
if not at home. Forcing your children to eat, especially
if they don’t like what is on the plate, is completely
. “Sit there until you finish” may be
how we learned, and may also be the only way you feel
able to achieve your goal, but think about it: the
experience of eating a pile of unwanted cabbage until
they feel sick is hardly going to make children jump for
joy the next time it is served.
This strict approach is very old-fashioned, and you
may win the battle but you definitely won’t win the
war. Delaying puddings used to be thought of as a good
idea too, but guess what? That doesn’t work either. “No
pudding until you have finished your main course” was
the standard line when most parents of today were
young and is still commonly used, but it only makes
sweet things seem more desirable.

[43～45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
In 1887, when the land was up for sale, grandpa
bought two hundred acres from the Granger family. In
1918, (a) he bought another two hundred. It was good
rich land. However, there were bank loans for and taxes on
the land. Unfortunately, there had not been enough money
from the cotton to pay both of them and live on. To
make things worse, the price of cotton dropped in 1930.
(B)
Some of it belonged to Stacey, Christopher, and John,
not to mention the part that belonged to big mama and
mama. However, papa never divided the land in his mind;
it was simply the land of our family. For it, (b) he would
work the long, hot summer pounding steel; mama would
teach and run the farm; and big mama, in her sixties,
would work like a woman in her twenties in the cotton
fields and keep the house; but always, the taxes would be
paid. Papa said that one day I would understand.
(C)
When he came back from Louisiana, I asked papa
why he had to go away and why the land was so
important. (c) He took my hand and said in his quiet
way: “Look out there, Cassie. All that belongs to you.
You will never have to live on other people’s land. As
long as the family survives, you will have your own
place. That’s important. You may not understand now,
but one day you will.” I looked at papa strangely, for I
knew that all the land did not belong to me.
(D)
That was why papa had gone to work, ending up in
Louisiana in 1931. (d) He set out looking for work, first
going far north and south, and finally west into Louisiana.
It was there he found work laying track for the railroad.
He worked the remainder of the year away from us, not
returning until the deep winter. The following spring after
the planting was finished, (e) he did the same. Now it
was 1933, and papa was again in Louisiana laying track.

Merely having goals clearly defined is not sufficient, for
one must also know, moment by moment, what precisely
needs to be done. For instance, a salesperson’s aim is to
conclude a sale profitably. However, each sale requires a
different approach: Should he be pushy or laid back,
authoritative or friendly? And what aspect of the product
should he emphasize? The answers to these questions depend
on variables that cannot be predicted in advance. This holds
true not only for sales but also for most human activities. One
must select a particular strategy appropriate to the occasion
and follow the chosen course of action. Doing so will ensure
more lasting success in reaching one’s goals.

There is strong research evidence that children perform
better in mathematics if music is incorporated in it. It has been
shown that mathematics is related with music in various
known ways so much that not putting the relationship to good
use in and out of school could only be to our disadvantage.
Researchers at a Los Angeles school found that 136 second
year elementary school pupils who learned to play the piano
and read music improved their numeracy skills. This could be
so since learning music emphasizes thinking in space and
time, and when pupils learn rhythm, they are learning ratios,
fractions and proportions. Other researchers investigated the
ways in which first and third grade teachers could integrate
music into their regular math classrooms. They concluded that
music-math integrated lessons had positive effects on three
mathematical ability areas of modeling, problem solving and
application.

Do you have the emotional state of mind to become a leader?
People pay close attention to a leader’s subtle expressions of
emotion through body language and facial expression. Some
emotions such as enthusiasm can quickly become contagious.
Others, such as depression or discouragement, can drag down
the entire organization. Leaders with positive emotional states
of mind are like human magnets. People naturally gravitate to
them and want to follow them. Such leaders inspire enthusiasm
in their organizations and attract the best people to work for
them. Conversely, leaders who emit negative emotional states
of mind, who are irritable and bossy, repel people and have few
followers.

Effective coaches prioritize. They focus on a single task
instead of trying to multitask. They understand that
multitasking is another way of saying you are going to
complete several tasks, none of which are going to be very
good. Yuhong Jiang, professor of psychology at Harvard
University, points out that the brain isn’t built to concentrate
on two things at once. It works more slowly if it tries to.
Effective coaches focus on those things that need to get done
and separate out everything else. Separating what’s important
from what’s not important is prioritizing. Ineffective coaches
fail to put the big tasks first. They either believe they have
unlimited time, thinking that they will have more time
tomorrow to get something done, or they underestimate how
much time they really do have. They have no ability to
estimate how long a task will take.

5 or More Times per Day, Canada, 2008
The above graph shows the percentages of fruit and
vegetable consumption 5 or more times per day by age group
and gender in Canada in 2008. (1) Most notably, in each age
group, the percentage of female consumption of fruit and
vegetables 5 or more times per day was higher than that of
males. (2) Across all age groups, less than 50 percent of males
consumed fruit and vegetables 5 or more times per day.
(3) Among female groups, the 25 to 34 age group showed the
highest percentage; among male groups, the 12 to 17 age group
did so. (4) The percentage gap between males and females in
fruit and vegetable consumption 5 or more times per day was
smallest in the 12 to 17 age group, and largest in the 18 to 24

Richard Porson, one of Britain’s most notable classical
scholars, was born on Christmas in 1759. His talents were
recognized early, and he was sent to Eton College by wealthy
sponsors at 15. Four years later, he entered Cambridge
University. He significantly improved Greek texts and edited
four plays written by Euripides. In 1806, he was elected
Principal Librarian at the newly founded London Institution.
During his lifetime, he collected a great many books on
classical literature. Although the number of books he owned
in total is simply unknown, an episode about his passion for
books is well-known: he carried so many books that he was
able to pull book after book out of his pocket when a student
tried to show off his knowledge of Greek writers. Despite his
fame as a classical scholar, he actually published little. On
September 25, 1808, three months before reaching age 49,
Porson died.

31. Early human societies were nomadic, based on hunting and

sources of food, qualities such as lightness, portability, and
adaptability were dominant criteria. With the evolution of more
settled rural societies based on agriculture, other characteristics,
other traditions of form appropriate to the new patterns of life,
rapidly emerged. It must be emphasized, however, that tradition
was not static, but constantly subject to minute variations
appropriate to people and their circumstances. Although
traditional forms reflected the experience of social groups,
specific manifestations could be adapted in various minute and
subtle ways to suit individual users’ needs. A chair could keep
its basic, accepted characteristics while still being closely
shaped in detail to the physique and proportions of a specific
person. This basic principle of allowed a
constant stream of incremental modifications to be introduced,

33. It is easy to find examples of correlations which are far
more systematic than could occur by chance and yet which it
would be absurd to treat as evidence of a direct causal link. For
instance, there is a high degree of correlation between shoe
size and vocabulary size: people with larger shoe sizes tend to
have much larger vocabularies than people with smaller shoe
sizes. But having larger feet does not cause anyone to gain a
larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary cause
your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation
is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and,
because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they
grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with
smaller feet have smaller vocabularies. In other words, foot
size and vocabulary size can be explained in terms of
from infancy
to adulthood: a cause which both observed phenomena have in
common. [3점]

If you walk into a store looking for a new computer and
the first salesperson you meet immediately points to a
group of computers and says, “Any of those are good,”
and then walks away, there is a good chance you will walk
away, too, and with good reason.
(A) That is, the reader is the writer’s “customer” and one
whose business or approval is one we need to seek. The
more you know about your reader, the greater the chances
you will meet his or her needs and expectations.
(B) Why? You were never asked what you were seeking, how
much you could spend, or if the computer would be used
for business or pleasure or your child’s homework
assignments.
(C) In brief, the salesperson never considered or asked about
your needs and preferences. Just as it would come as no
surprise to learn the salesperson who was indifferent to a

According to one traditional definition, aesthetics is the
branch of philosophy that deals with beauty, especially
beauty in the arts. Examining the pleasing features of the
Mona Lisa or a snow-capped mountain, for example,
would come under aesthetics.
(A) Consider Picasso’s Guernica, a huge (11-ft. × 25.6-ft.)
painting in black, white, and grey that he made in
response to the slaughter of Spanish civilians by German
and Italian warplanes during the Spanish Civil War.
Images of a cruel war dominate the canvas.
(B) That definition seems too narrow, however, since works of
art and natural objects may interest us in other ways than by
being beautiful. Instead of evoking admiration of beauty,
artists may evoke puzzlement, shock, and even disgust.
(C) This work is widely admired but not for being beautiful.
So a better definition of aesthetics would be that it is the
branch of philosophy that deals with the ways things
please people in being experienced.

Analysis of the errors leads the teacher to modify the
teaching of these procedures, using the language ‘seven
and three more’ rather than ‘seven, count on three’.
A 5-year-old doing addition problems by counting on makes
the same error repeatedly, with responses such as: 7 + 3 = 9,
6 + 5 = 10 and 8 + 4 = 11. ( (1) ) The teacher asks the pupil to
show how these answers were obtained and notices that in
doing the addition of 3 to 7, the pupil counts ‘seven, eight,
nine’, while turning up three fingers in turn. ( (2) ) The pupil
is ‘counting on 3 from 7’ but incorrectly starting at 7. ( (3) )
The teacher recalls similar errors that some pupils made when
doing addition problems by counting on along a number
line. ( (4) ) This is immediately effective. ( (5) ) So the
teacher reinforces this particular language pattern in
subsequent oral work with the whole class.

Still, many believe we will eventually reach a point at
which conflict with the finite nature of resources is
inevitable.
Can we sustain our standard of living in the same ecological
space while consuming the resources of that space? This
question is particularly relevant since we are living in an era
of skyrocketing fuel costs and humans’ ever-growing carbon
footprints. ( (1) ) Some argue that we are already at a
breaking point because we have nearly exhausted the Earth’s
finite carrying capacity. ( (2) ) However, it’s possible that
innovations and cultural changes can expand Earth’s capacity.
( (3) ) We are already seeing this as the world economies are
increasingly looking at “green,” renewable industries like
solar and hydrogen energy. ( (4) ) That means survival could
ultimately depend on getting the human population below its
carrying capacity. ( (5) ) Otherwise, without population
control, the demand for resources will eventually exceed an
ecosystem’s ability to provide it. [3점]

Scientific experiments should be designed to show that your
hypothesis is wrong and should be conducted completely
objectively with no possible subjective influence on the
outcome. (1) Unfortunately few, if any, scientists are truly
objective as they have often decided long before the
experiment is begun what they would like the result to be.
(2) This means that very often bias is (unintentionally)
introduced into the experiment, the experimental procedure or
the interpretation of results. (3) It is all too easy to justify to
yourself why an experiment which does not fit with your
expectations should be ignored, and why one which provides
the results you ‘hoped for’ is the right one. (4) It is important
to draw a meaningful result from the experiment on peer
group activities. (5) This can be partly avoided by conducting
experiments ‘blinded’ and by asking others to check your data
or repeat experiments.

Certain species are more crucial to the maintenance of
their ecosystem than others. Such species, called keystone
species, are vital in determining the nature and structure of
the entire ecosystem. The fact that other species depend on
or are greatly affected by the keystone species is revealed
when the keystone species is removed. It is in this sense
that we should draw attention to fig trees. Different species
of fig trees may be keystone species in tropical rain
forests. Although figs collectively produce a continuous
crop of fruits, fruit-eating monkeys, birds, bats, and other
vertebrates of the forest do not normally consume large
quantities of figs in their diets. During the time of year
when other fruits are less plentiful, however, fig trees
become important in sustaining fruit-eating vertebrates.
Should the fig trees disappear, most of the fruit-eating
vertebrates would be eliminated. Protecting fig trees in
such tropical rainforest ecosystems is an important
conservation goal because it increases the likelihood that
monkeys, birds, bats, and other vertebrates will survive.

True understanding inevitably requires a knowledge of
context. The proper way of understanding a beast in a zoo is
a telling example. At the zoo, visitors may witness a great
beast pacing behind the bars of its cage. They may observe
and admire the creature, its amazing bone structure, and its
magnificent coat. However, no matter how long visitors
spend in front of that cage, they will never truly understand
the beast. True understanding can only come from seeing the
creature in its natural surroundings and, in turn, the ways in
which its presence affects its environment.
What is true of the mysterious beast in the zoo is also true
of science. To fully understand science, it must be
considered within the society in which it functions. Science
is not conducted in a . It is embedded within a
social fabric, and just as a flesh-and-blood beast influences
and is influenced by its environment, so too do science and
society mutually influence one another. Society, through
ethical and economic constraints, exerts a powerful influence
on what science accomplishes. At the same time, the results
of science have profound, and sometimes unexpected,
impacts on every human being on earth. Therefore, to make
sense of science-related issues, it is critical to recognize the
bidirectional relationship between science and society.

(A)
Peter Anderson was exhausted when he finally opened the
front door of his apartment. He teaches first graders, which
means he lives in a world of riddles, birthday cakes, and
pointless stories. (a) His world is dominated by 6-year-olds.
Throwing himself with his leather bag on the long,
comfortable sofa, he closed his eyes and reviewed the events
of the day.
(B)
It was held in a seminar room where Anderson met the
principal for the first time three years ago. The principal
asked why he chose to work with young children. (b) He
answered that he loved helping children learn to write their
names for the first time, finding someone a new friend, and
sharing in the joy of reading. But, as time passed, his
commitment and passion seemed to fade gradually. He
recalled his strong conviction during the interview.
(C)
That’s why Anderson took the job in the first place even
though some of his friends attempted to persuade him to be a
lawyer or businessman. (c) He shook his head and opened his
eyes. As he struggled to get up, he saw something fall from his
bag. It was a birthday card from his students, decorated with
all kinds of odd-shaped but colorful hearts and scribbled
names. “Dear Mr. Anderson, happy birthday to you. It’s our
surprise gift for you. We love you!” Anderson could not help
but smile. He already felt much better.
(D)
Today was especially busy and wearying, and Anderson
wondered whether he was really suitable for teaching. He was
stressed as kids constantly sought (d) his attention. At snack
time, Emily wanted him to open her milk carton, so he did. As
she was drinking, Scott spilled his milk and Anderson had to
help (e) him clean it up. Then Jenny, Andrew, Mark, and . . . .
Kids never ceased. However, he still loved them. That’s also
what he had said in the interview for the position.

Assertiveness may seem to some people to be uncharacteristic
of counselors. If your picture of a counselor is someone who
never disagrees, always “goes along,” wants everything to be
nice all the time, and only does what other people want him or
her to do, this is not a picture of an assertive counselor. Being
assertive does not have to mean being disagreeable. Being a
counselor does not mean that you should simply be silent
when someone tells a racist joke. An assertive counselor
would find a way to call that person’s attention to the fact
that the joke is racist, explaining how it offended the hearer,
and suggesting ways similar jokes could be avoided. Being
assertive is a highly developed skill ― it should fit nicely in
the counselor’s repertoire of techniques.

The negative effects of extrinsic motivators such as grades
have been documented with students from different cultures.
Although this matter is more complex than simply regarding
all extrinsic rewards as controlling or diminishing learning,
we agree with Richard Ryan and his colleagues that people
across different cultures are likely to express more satisfaction
with their lives when their primary goals are intrinsic rather
than extrinsic. Another consistent research finding is that
when a learning activity is undertaken explicitly to attain
some extrinsic reward, people respond by seeking the least
demanding way of ensuring the reward. Since there are three
decades of evidence that dominating instruction with a system
of controlling external rewards may contribute to inferior
learning, using a pedagogy based on theories of intrinsic
motivation appears to be a more reasonable and effective
approach to enhancing learning among culturally diverse
students.

Twin sirens hide in the sea of history, tempting those
seeking to understand and appreciate the past onto the reefs of
misunderstanding and misinterpretation. These twin dangers
are temporocentrism and ethnocentrism. Temporocentrism is
the belief that your times are the best of all possible times. All
other times are thus inferior. Ethnocentrism is the belief that
your culture is the best of all possible cultures. All other
cultures are thus inferior. Temporocentrism and ethnocentrism
unite to cause individuals and cultures to judge all other
individuals and cultures by the “superior” standards of their
current culture. This leads to a total lack of perspective when
dealing with past and / or foreign cultures and a resultant
misunderstanding and misappreciation of them. Temporocentrism
and ethnocentrism tempt moderns into unjustified criticisms

When we remark with surprise that someone “looks young”
for his or her chronological age, we are observing that we
all age biologically at different rates. Scientists have good
evidence that this apparent difference is real. It is likely that age
changes begin in different parts of the body at different times
and that the rate of annual change varies among various cells,
tissues, and organs, as well as from person to person. Unlike
the passage of time, biological aging resists easy measurement.
What we would like to have is one or a few measurable
biological changes that mirror all other biological age changes
without reference to the passage of time, so that we could say,
for example, that someone who is chronologically eighty years
old is biologically sixty years old. This kind of measurement
would help explain why one eighty-year-old has so many more
youthful qualities than does another eighty-year-old, who may
be biologically eighty or even ninety years old.

Known for his devotion to each of his paintings, Protogenes
was an ancient Greek painter and a rival of Apelles. He was
born in Caunus, on the coast of Caria, but lived most of his
life in Rhodes. Little else is known of him. But there are
some accounts of his paintings. The Ialysus and the Satyr
were the most well-known among his works. Protogenes spent
approximately seven years painting the Ialysus, a depiction of a
local hero of a town in Rhodes. After remaining in Rhodes for
at least 200 years, it was carried off to Rome. There later it
was destroyed by fire. Protogenes worked on the Satyr during
Demetrius Poliorcetes’ attack on Rhodes from 305 to 304 B.C.
Interestingly, the garden in which he painted the Satyr was in
the middle of the enemy’s camp. Protogenes is said to have been
about seventy years of age when the Satyr was completed.

The Greeks’ focus on the salient object and its attributes led
to (1) their failure to understand the fundamental nature of
causality. Aristotle explained that a stone falling through the
air is due to the stone having the property of “gravity.” But of
course a piece of wood (2) tossed into water floats instead of
sinking. This phenomenon Aristotle explained as being due
to the wood having the property of “levity”! In both cases
the focus is (3) exclusively on the object, with no attention
paid to the possibility that some force outside the object
might be relevant. But the Chinese saw the world as consisting
of continuously interacting substances, so their attempts to
understand it (4) causing them to be oriented toward the
complexities of the entire “field,” that is, the context or
environment as a whole. The notion (5) that events always
occur in a field of forces would have been completely

The Atitlán Giant Grebe was a large, flightless bird that had
evolved from the much more widespread and smaller
Pied-billed Grebe. By 1965 there were only around 80 birds
left on Lake Atitlán. One immediate reason was easy enough
to spot: the local human population was cutting down the reed
beds at a furious rate. This (A) accommodation / destruction
was driven by the needs of a fast growing mat-making
industry. But there were other problems. An American airline
was intent on developing the lake as a tourist destination for
fishermen. However, there was a major problem with this
idea: the lake (B) lacked / supported any suitable sporting
fish! To compensate for this rather obvious defect, a specially

The dancers stood on a two-step elevated stage, so that there
was a natural gap between those who came to dance and those
who came to watch. The host randomly pulled the name of a
well-known dancer, Linx, out of a hat. People cheered.
According to the format, Linx had to “call out” another dancer
to battle him on stage. Instead of deliberately choosing
someone, however, (1) he decided to select his opponent
randomly by making himself into a human spin-wheel. He
propelled himself into a backspin, covered (2) his eyes, and
extended his arm above his head. When his body finally
stopped spinning, (3) his arm pointed away from the dancers
on stage and directly at Dan Tres, standing among the
spectators. The crowd erupted in “Ohhhhs!” because (4) he
was an older family man who had not danced hip-hop in many
years, while the much younger Linx was a nimble b-boy. Linx
looked embarrassed, but nonetheless (5) he called out the
respected elder to battle.

31. When two cultures come into contact, they do not
exchange every cultural item. If that were the case, there
would be no cultural differences in the world today. Instead,
only a small number of cultural elements ever spread from
one culture to another. Which cultural item is accepted
depends largely on the item’s use and compatibility with
already existing cultural traits. For example, it is not likely
that men’s hair dyes designed to “get out the gray” will spread
into parts of rural Africa where a person’s status is elevated
with advancing years. Even when a(n) is
consistent with a society’s needs, there is still no guarantee
that it will be accepted. For example, most people in the
United States using US customary units (e.g., inch, foot, yard,
mile, etc.) have resisted adopting the metric system even
though making such a change would enable US citizens to
interface with the rest of the world more efficiently. [3점]

32. Some distinctions between good and bad are hardwired into
our biology. Infants enter the world ready to respond to pain as
bad and to sweet (up to a point) as good. In many situations,
however, the boundary between good and bad is a reference
point that changes over time and depends on the immediate
circumstances. Imagine that you are out in the country on a cold
night, inadequately dressed for the pouring rain, your clothes
soaked. A stinging cold wind completes your misery. As you
wander around, you find a large rock that provides some shelter
from the fury of the elements. The biologist Michel Cabanac
would call the experience of that moment intensely pleasurable
because it functions, as pleasure normally does, to indicate the
direction of .
The pleasant relief will not last very long, of course, and you
will soon be shivering behind the rock again, driven by your
renewed suffering to seek better shelter. [3점]
* shiver: 떨다
(1) a permanent emotional adjustment to circumstantial demands
(2) enhancing self-consciousness through physical suffering
(3) a biologically significant improvement of circumstances
(4) judging desirable and undesirable conditions impartially
(5) a mentally pre-determined inclination for emotional stability

33. Research and development for seed improvement has long
been a public domain and government activity for the
common good. However, private capital started to flow into
seed production and took it over as a sector of the economy,
creating an artificial split between the two aspects of the
seed’s nature: its role as means of production and its role as
product. This process gained pace after the invention of
hybrid breeding of maize in the late 1920s. Today most maize
seed cultivated are hybrids. The companies that sell them are
able to keep the distinct parent lines from farmers, and the
grain that they produce is not suited for seed saving and
replanting. The combination guarantees that farmers will
have to . In the
1990s the extension of patent laws as the only intellectual
property rights tool into the area of seed varieties started to
create a growing market for private seed companies. [3점]
* maize: 옥수수
(1) buy more seed from the company each season
(2) use more chemical fertilizer than before
(3) pioneer markets for their food products
(4) increase the efficiency of food production
(5) search for ways to maintain rural communities
34. Long before Walt Whitman wrote Leaves of Grass, poets had
addressed themselves to fame. Horace, Petrarch, Shakespeare,
Milton, and Keats all hoped that poetic greatness would grant
them a kind of earthly immortality. Whitman held a similar
faith that for centuries the world would value his poems. But
to this ancient desire to live forever on the page, he added a
new sense of fame. Readers would not simply attend to the
poet’s work; they would be attracted to the greatness of his
personality. They would see in his poems a vibrant cultural
performance, an individual springing from the book with
tremendous charisma and appeal. Out of the political rallies
and electoral parades that marked Jacksonian America, Whitman
defined poetic fame in relation to the crowd. Other poets
might look for their inspiration from the goddess of poetry.
Whitman’s poet sought .
In the instability of American democracy, fame would be
dependent on celebrity, on the degree to which the people
rejoiced in the poet and his work. [3점]

(1) a refuge from public attention
(2) poetic purity out of political chaos
(3) immortality in literature itself
(4) the approval of his contemporaries

Some people make few intentional changes in life. Sure,
over time they may get fatter, gather lines, and go gray.
(A) They train for marathons, quit smoking, switch fields,
write plays, take up the guitar, or learn to tango even if
they never danced before in their lives. What is the
difference between these two groups of people?
(B) But they wear their hair the same way, buy the same
brand of shoes, eat the same breakfast, and stick to
routines for no reason other than the ease of a
comfortable, predictable life. Yet as both research and
real life show, many others do make important changes.
(C) It’s their perspective. People who change do not question
whether change is possible or look for reasons they
cannot change. They simply decide on a change they
want and do what is necessary to accomplish it.
Changing, which always stems from a firm decision,
becomes job number one.

Sometimes, after punishment has been administered a
few times, it needn’t be continued, because the mere threat
of punishment is enough to induce the desired behavior.
(A) Avoidance training, however, doesn’t always work in our
favor. For instance, a child who has been repeatedly
criticized for poor performance on math may learn to
dodge difficult math problems in order to avoid further
punishment.
(B) Unfortunately, because of this avoidance, the child fails
to develop his math skills and therefore improve the
capabilities he has, and so a vicious cycle has set in.
The avoidance must be unlearned through some positive
experiences with math in order for this cycle to be broken.
(C) Psychologists call this avoidance training because the
person is learning to avoid the possibility of a punishing
consequence. Avoidance training is responsible for many
everyday behaviors. It has taught you to carry an
umbrella when it looks like rain to avoid the punishment
of getting wet, and to keep your hand away from a hot
iron to avoid the punishment of a burn.

Surprised by the vision of an unfamiliar silhouette pushing
into the house, these dogs were using their eyes instead of
their noses.
Remember when you were little and you imagined that
adults had infinite power? Surely someone who could drive
the car, open the juice container, and reach the sink could
make it stop raining. ( (1) ) I think that’s the same expectation
that we have with respect to our dogs and their ability to
smell. ( (2) ) Because they are so good at using their noses,
we assume that they can smell anything, anytime. ( (3) ) But
dogs use other senses, too, and the brains of both humans
and dogs tend to intensify one sense at a time. ( (4) ) Many
owners have been snapped at by their dogs when they
returned home with a new hairdo or a new coat. ( (5) ) Their
noses may be remarkable, but they’re not always switched on.

Even so, it is not the money per se that is valuable, but the
fact that it can potentially yield more positive experiences.
Money ― beyond the bare minimum necessary for food and
shelter ― is nothing more than a means to an end. Yet so
often we confuse means with ends, and sacrifice happiness
(end) for money (means). It is easy to do this when material
wealth is elevated to the position of the ultimate end, as it so
often is in our society. ( (1) ) This is not to say that the
accumulation and production of material wealth is in itself
wrong. ( (2) ) Material prosperity can help individuals, as well
as society, attain higher levels of happiness. ( (3) ) Financial
security can liberate us from work we do not find meaningful
and from having to worry about the next paycheck. ( (4) )
Moreover, the desire to make money can challenge and inspire
us. ( (5) ) Material wealth in and of itself does not necessarily
generate meaning or lead to emotional wealth. [3점]

Food intake is essential for the survival of every living
organism. The failure to detect spoiled or toxic food can
have deadly consequences. Therefore, it is not surprising that
humans use all their five senses to analyze food quality. (1) A
first judgment about the value of a food source is made on
its appearance and smell. (2) Food that looks and smells
attractive is taken into the mouth. (3) The value of a particular
food is an estimation of how good it is, based on its level of
vitamins, minerals, or calories. (4) Here, based on a complex
sensory analysis that is not only restricted to the sense of taste
but also includes smell, touch, and hearing, the final decision
whether to swallow or reject food is made. (5) Frequently,
this complex interaction between different senses is
inappropriately referred to as ‘taste’ although it should be
better called flavor perception, because it uses multiple
senses.

Performance must be judged in terms of what is under
the control of the individuals being evaluated rather than
those influences on performance that are beyond their
control. There can be broad, influential factors, sometimes
of an economic nature, that hold down the performance
of everyone being judged. One example is in sales. If there
is a general downturn in the economy and products or
services are not being purchased with the same frequency
as in the previous year, sales could be down, for example,
by an average of 15%. This 15% (actually －15%) figure
would then represent “average” performance. Perhaps the
best salesperson in the year had only a 3% drop in sales
over the previous year. Thus, “good” performance in this
situation is a smaller loss compared to some average or
norm group.
󰀻
In performance evaluation, we should consider (A)
factors affecting the individual’s performance rather than
(B) figures only.
(A) (B)
(1) contextual …… put aside
(2) contextual …… rely on
(3) controllable …… put aside
(4) positive …… ignore
(5) positive …… rely on

We might describe science that has no known practical
value as basic science or basic research. Our exploration of
worlds such as Jupiter would be called basic science, and it is
easy to argue that basic science is not worth the effort and
expense because it has no known practical use. Of course, the
problem is that we have no way of knowing what knowledge
will be of use until we acquire that knowledge. In the middle
of the 19th century, Queen Victoria is supposed to have asked
physicist Michael Faraday what good his experiments with
electricity and magnetism were. He answered, “Madam, what
good is a baby?” Of course, Faraday’s experiments were the
beginning of the electronic age. Many of the practical uses
of scientific knowledge that fill our world ― transistors,
vaccines, plastics ― began as basic research. Basic scientific
research provides the raw materials that technology and
engineering use to solve problems.
Basic scientific research has yet one more important use
that is so valuable it seems an insult to refer to it as merely
functional. Science is the study of nature, and as we learn
more about how nature works, we learn more about what our
existence in this universe means for us. The seemingly
knowledge we gain from space probes to other
worlds tells us about our planet and our own role in the
scheme of nature. Science tells us where we are and what we
are, and that knowledge is beyond value.

(A)
The midday sun was glorious. The high school grounds
were filled with well-dressed people, posing in fancy dresses
and suits for cheerful photographers. Congratulations, hugs,
and laughter were contagious. Hannah looked at all the
familiar faces that had been part of (a) her life for the last
few years. Soon her mother would be joining them. She
recalled the first day of school when she had stood in that
same place, in the middle of many anxious freshmen, some
of whom had become her closest friends.
(B)
“Hannah, you look so serious. What are you thinking
about?” “Oh, Mom, just, you know.” Her mother smiled.
“You’ll miss this place, won’t you?” Hannah nodded.
“Quick,” her mother said, “stand over there . . . and smile,
Hannah. You have such a pretty smile.” (b) She hurried out
her cell phone, zoomed in on her daughter, and realized
suddenly that she was looking at a young lady. “You’re all
grown-up,” she whispered. Hannah took more photos with
her teachers in the school garden. She wished all the
memories would remain in her mind forever.
(C)
Hannah struggled with the many class hours, the endless
assignments, and the exams. However, there were exciting
events like sports days and school festivals. How could (c) she
ever forget her second year! She had sung and danced with
her friends in the festival, part of a sensational performance.
After that, she had become more confident and active. Her
thoughts wandering, Hannah vaguely heard her mother’s
voice. “Here you are!” Her mother hurried over, and gave
(d) her a bundle of lilies and roses and a big hug.
(D)
That day was unusually foggy as if something mysterious
were ahead. Hannah was nervous and trembling. The principal
was energetically addressing them, talking of the challenges
and thrills of high school life, but she could not concentrate.
Later, a tall, strict-looking man introduced himself as (e) her
homeroom teacher. The classroom was old, but neat and
inviting. Hannah was seated in the fifth row, hallway side,
even though she had wanted a window seat. High school life
soon proved as challenging as the principal had predicted.
