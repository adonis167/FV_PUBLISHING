I have seen people who are very good at their jobs but are
poor at presenting themselves and, hence, do not convince
the audience of their capabilities. Presentation is so crucially
important and will make the difference between getting a
sale or not. Some people are naturally good presenters, but
brushing up on your skills in this area will prove profitable.
There are lots of courses available that are good. Try Think
Business where courses are cheap or even free. The ABC
Marketing Institute also offers very good presentation skills
courses. A good course will help you structure your
presentations and improve your own personal style. I would
recommend one that films you while you are presenting and
then gives a critique of your style.
(1) 대인 관계 개선 방안을 제시하려고
(2) 프레젠테이션 소프트웨어를 광고하려고
(3) 청중과의 상호 작용의 중요성을 강조하려고

(5) 발표력 향상을 위한 강좌에 대해 알려 주려고

John was as famous for his tennis skills as he was for his
fits of temper on the court. One afternoon, I was playing an
important singles match against John. When things didn’t go
his way, (1) he began to go downhill, complaining about the
game, screaming at himself, and slamming his racket. It
looked like (2) he was having a public nervous breakdown.
In the end, the guy who didn’t “deserve to be on the same
court” with (3) him won in three tough sets. After the match,
John announced his retirement from tennis at the age of
twenty seven. He explained, “When I start losing to players
like (4) him, I’ve got to reconsider what I’m doing even
playing this game.” If he thought I’d be insulted, (5) he was
wrong. In fact, I loved it.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes,
had a great sense of delicacy (1) where other persons’ feelings
were concerned. He once paid a visit to George Meredith,
the novelist, when Meredith was old and weak. Meredith
suffered from an unusual disease that caused him (2) to fall
occasionally. The two men were walking up a path toward
Meredith’s summerhouse, Conan Doyle in the lead, when
Conan Doyle heard the old novelist fall behind him. He
judged by the sound (3) which the fall was a mere slip and
could not have hurt Meredith. Therefore, he did not turn and
he strode on as if he (4) had heard nothing. “He was a
fiercely proud old man,” Conan Doyle later explained, “and
my instincts told me that his humiliation in being helped up
would be (5) far greater than any relief I could give him.”

There is an old Japanese legend about a man renowned for
his flawless manners visiting a remote village. Wanting to
honor as well as observe him, the villagers prepared a
banquet. As they sat to eat, all eyes were on their noble
guest. Everyone looked at (A) what / how the man held his
chopsticks, so that they could imitate him. But then, by an
unfortunate accident, as the mannered man raised a slippery
slice of tofu to his lips, he (B) placed / was placed the
tiniest bit of excess pressure on his chopsticks, propelling
his tofu through the air and onto his neighbor’s lap. After a
brief moment of surprise, in order to preserve the myth of
their guest’s perfection and keep (C) him / himself from any
embarrassment, all the villagers at the banquet began to fling
tofu into each other’s laps.
(A) (B) (C)
(1) what …… placed …… him
(2) what …… was placed …… himself
(3) how …… placed …… him
(4) how …… placed …… himself

22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
The famous expression, “Keep your friends close, but keep
your enemies even closer,” was exemplified well in Nelson
Mandela’s attempt to learn Afrikaans, the language of his
enemy. (1) Mandela first began to learn the language of the
Afrikaners, the white South Africans, in the 1960’s to the
disapproval of his followers. (2) They thought it was a waste
of time, but Mandela felt that it was crucial for gaining insight
into the world view of the Afrikaners. (3) By obtaining this
perspective of how the Afrikaners looked at the world, he
would be able to understand their strengths and weaknesses.
(4) In many ways, Mandela’s greatest contribution as president
of the South Africans including the Afrikaners was the way
he chose to leave the presidency. (5) This understanding of the
Afrikaners proved to be invaluable later in successfully
persuading them to accept his people’s demands.

23. The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as
you wish. When you can do this without having to force
people or hurt them, when they willingly grant you what you
desire, then your power is untouchable. The best way to
achieve this position is to create a relationship of dependence.
The master requires your services; he is weak, or unable to
function without you; you have involved yourself in his work
so deeply that doing away with you would bring him great
difficulty, or at least would mean valuable time lost in
training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is
established, you have the upper hand to make the master do
as you wish. It is the classic case of the servant of the king
who actually __________ the king.
(1) controls (2) avoids (3) admires
(4) rescues (5) entertains
24. If you were a butterfly, would you be attracted to a more
colorful flower or a less colorful one? Most of you would
probably prefer the more colorful option. The same is true
for pollinators such as bees and butterflies. For years,
biologists have known that flowers use striking colors,
scents, elaborately shaped petals, and nectar to attract
pollinators. Recent studies, however, reveal another powerful
tool of attraction used by flowers: ____________________.
Scientists have discovered that mobile flowers are visited
more often by pollinating insects than their more static
counterparts. It is almost as if the flowers are waving to the
insects, saying, “Welcome. Come here and have a drink.”
Along with this interesting finding, scientists have also
concluded that, due to their greater range of motion, flowers
with long, thin stalks attract more insects.
* pollinator: 꽃가루 매개자
(1) moving in the wind (2) fancy color scheme
(3) unique tasting nectar (4) having deep roots
(5) receiving vocal messages
25. A brilliant friend of mine once told me, “When you
suddenly see a problem, something happens that you have the
answer―before you are able to put it into words. It is all
done subconsciously. This has happened many times to me.”
This feeling of knowing ____________________________ is
common. The French philosopher and mathematician Blaise
Pascal is famous for saying, “The heart has its reasons
that reason cannot know.” The great nineteenth-century
mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss also admitted that
intuition often led him to ideas he could not immediately
prove. He said, “I have had my results for a long time; but
I do not yet know how I am to arrive at them.” Fittingly so,
sometimes true genius simply cannot be put into words.
(1) the meaning of the feelings in your heart
(2) without being able to say how one knows
(3) the way others solve the problems they face
(4) how to use the right words to persuade others
(5) someone that you have never met before in your life
26. Researchers have come to understand how the African village
weaverbird prevents itself from being taken advantage of by
cuckoos―it is all down to the speckles on the eggs. David Lahti
and his colleagues have described how village weaverbirds lay
eggs which all show a very similar pattern of speckles, suggesting
that if a cuckoo laid an egg in the nest, the weaverbird will
be able to spot the foreign egg almost immediately. But when
the researchers studied two colonies of the birds that had been
introduced more than 200 years ago to two islands without any
cuckoos, they found that those birds’ eggs no longer exhibited
the same speckle patterns. In a neat demonstration of the power
of evolution, these results show how, in the absence of pressure
from parasitic cuckoos, the appearance of the eggs has altered
because ________________________________________. [3점]
* speckle: 얼룩, 반점 ** parasitic: 기생하는
(1) nest building instincts are determined by genetic factors
(2) having a similar pattern is no longer so much of an advantage
(3) invasions by cuckoos have forced the birds to become strong
(4) adapting to a new environment takes a certain amount of time
(5) their unique speckle patterns attracted too many enemies
27. Why don’t we think differently more often? The reason is
that we do not need to be creative for most of what we do.
For example, we do not need to be creative when we are
driving on the freeway, or riding in an elevator, or waiting in
line at a grocery store. ________________________ when it
comes to the business of living. For most of our activities,
these routines are indispensable. Without them, our lives
would be in chaos, and we would not get much accomplished.
If you got up this morning and started contemplating the
shape of your toothbrush or questioning the meaning of toast,
you probably would not make it to work.
(1) We are creatures of habit
(2) Social restrictions do not apply
(3) We pay more attention to safety
(4) Personal accomplishments do matter
(5) Creative thinking is highly recommended
28. In Chinese food, the idea is that it should be boiling hot,
because that is crucial to its flavor, embodied in the phrase
wok hei, which means the ‘breath’ or essence of the
combination of tastes added by a hot wok. In 2005 Belgian
researchers at Leuven University confirmed just how the
link between temperature and taste works. They identified
microscopic channels in our taste buds, which seem to
respond differently at different temperatures. Apparently, the
higher the temperature, the more intense the flavor. This is
why _____________________________________________,
which is why ice cream makers add stacks of sugar―as you
can tell all too clearly when ice cream melts. In a similar
way, some bitter tastes, like tea, taste better when hot
because they are more intense.
* wok: 중국 요리용 냄비
(1) ice cream tastes better when tea flavors are added
(2) ice cream does not taste that sweet straight from the fridge
(3) they serve ice cream for dessert in Chinese restaurants
(4) it is not recommended to eat ice cream while drinking hot tea
(5) ice cream tastes sweeter especially in the winter time
29. Unlike the novel, short story, or play, film is not handy to
study; it cannot be effectively frozen on the printed page.
The novel and short story are relatively easy to study because
they are written to be read. The stage play is slightly more
difficult to study because it is written to be performed. But
plays are printed, and because they rely heavily on the
spoken word, imaginative readers can create at least a pale
imitation of the experience they might have watching a
performance on stage. This cannot be said of the screenplay,
for a film depends greatly on visual and other nonverbal
elements that are not easily expressed in writing. The
screenplay requires so much filling in by our imagination that
we cannot really approximate the experience of a film by
reading a screenplay, and reading a screenplay is worthwhile
only if we have already seen the film. Thus, most screenplays
 . [3점]
(1) rely more on the spoken word than stage plays
(2) attract a much wider readership than short stories
(3) do share many elements with other literary genres
(4) are popular though it requires extra effort to study them
(5) are published not to be read but rather to be remembered

Every writer is starting from a different point and is
bound for a different destination. Yet many writers are
paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with
everybody else who is trying to write and presumably
doing it better. This can often happen in a writing class.
Inexperienced students are chilled to find themselves in the
same class with students whose articles have appeared in
the college newspaper. But writing for the college paper is
no great credit; I have often found that the hares who write
for the paper are overtaken by the tortoises who move
studiously toward the goal of mastering the craft. The same
fear hangs around freelance writers, who see the work of
other writers appearing in magazines while their own keeps
returning in the mail. Forget the competition and go at
your own pace.
(1) 글쓰기를 두려워하지 마라.
(2) 글을 빨리 쓸 수 있도록 연습하라.

The traditional American view was that fences were out
of place in the American landscape. This notion turned up
(1) repeatedly in nineteenth-century American writing about
the landscape. One author after another severely (2) criticized
“the Englishman’s insultingly inhospitable brick wall topped
with broken bottles.” Frank J. Scott, an early landscape
architect who had a large impact on the look of America’s
first suburbs, worked tirelessly to (3) rid the landscape of
fences. Writing in 1870, he held that to narrow our neighbors’
views of the free graces of Nature was (4) unselfish and
undemocratic. To drive through virtually any American suburb
today, where every lawn steps right up to the street in a
gesture of (5) openness and welcoming, is to see how
completely such views have triumphed.

A case of the negative impact of an innovation was reported
by a researcher examining the spread of the snowmobile among
the Skolt Lapps in northern Finland. The snowmobile offered
considerable relative advantages to the Lapps who used reindeer
sleds as their primary means of transportation. It was much
faster, making trips for supplies more efficient. However, the
snowmobile had (A) beneficial / disastrous effects on the Lapps.
First, the noise of the snowmobile frightened the reindeer, who
in turn exhibited health problems and produced fewer calves
each year. Herd sizes were (B) reduced / increased further by
herders who sold some of their reindeer to buy a snowmobile.
With smaller herds, the Lapps found it more difficult to survive,
and the snowmobile was eventually viewed as a product that
drove the Lapps into (C) poverty / wealth .
(A) (B) (C)
(1) beneficial …… reduced …… poverty
(2) disastrous …… reduced …… poverty
(3) disastrous …… increased …… wealth
(4) disastrous …… increased …… poverty
(5) beneficial …… reduced …… wealth

33. One of the most potentially productive trends in education
today is the focus on interdisciplinary studies: teaching math
as it applies to science, for example, or relating the various
humanities. This applies to art education, too. If we trivialize
art and remove it from the core of a mainstream education, we
not only deny our students full access to one of humankind’s
most profound experiences, but we miss countless opportunities
to improve their grasp of other subjects as well. Moreover, we
deny students access to an extremely useful kind of training
and a productive mode of thought. We should also consider that
the more legitimately we weave art into the fabric of the
general curriculum, the better our students will understand the
important role art plays in culture.
(1) importance of early fine art education
(2) necessity of integrating art in the curriculum
(3) shortage of teaching materials in art education
(4) causes of decrease in the number of art classes
(5) results of interdisciplinary education in the humanities
34. Our love for another person pulls us out of ourselves
and lifts our thoughts to a grander scale: How can I make
the world better for this person? When I was young, the
only love I experienced was the immature, selfish love of
“I love her because she makes me feel good.” Now I think
about the woman I love in terms of what she wants. I want
to make her happy because I cannot be happy when she is
unhappy. We discover that the act of giving true love is
more powerful than getting the hug you need―if we can
get over our own hunger for love, then we have reached
the state of pure love, of being connected to a larger ideal,
bigger than our own individual life.

The graph above shows the percentage of population growth
and forest loss in the continents of the world since 1990.
(1) Africa shows the highest percentage of population growth,
whereas Europe shows the lowest percentage of population
growth. (2) Africa also shows the highest percentage of forest
loss, followed by Latin America, Oceania, Asia and North
America. (3) The only continent that exhibits a negative
percentage in forest loss, which translates to forest gain, is
Europe. (4) A point of note is that while Asia and Oceania
have similar percentages of population growth, Oceania
displays less forest loss than Asia. (5) Overall, there are only
two continents whose percentage of forest loss is greater than
five percent.
36. Jaisalmer에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Known as the Golden City, Jaisalmer, a former caravan
center on the route to the Khyber Pass, rises from a sea of
sand, its 30-foot-high walls and medieval sandstone fort
sheltering palaces that soar into the sapphire sky. With its
tiny winding lanes and hidden temples, Jaisalmer is straight
out of The Arabian Nights. So little has the way of life
altered here that it is easy to imagine yourself back in the
13th century. It is the only fortress city in India still
functioning, with one quarter of its population living within
the walls. It is just far enough off the beaten path to have
been spared damage from tourists. The city’s wealth
originally came from the substantial tolls it placed on
passing merchants.
(1) Khyber Pass의 한 가운데 위치하고 있다.

않는 것은?
The best-known female artist of the sixteenth century,
Sofonisba Anguissola, was born into a noble Italian family.
Her mother died young, leaving her wealthy husband with five
talented daughters. Unusual of the time, this liberal father gave
his daughters a full classical education including painting. It
was this enlightened attitude that enabled Anguissola to earn
her own living as a portrait painter in the Spanish court and
helped her to rise above the restrictions of her class and
gender. In Three Sisters Playing Chess, Anguissola broke
with tradition by concentrating on those scenes and models
available to her, painting her sisters in a domestic setting.
This gave the portrait an immediacy, which allowed the
contemporary Italian art historian Vasari to attribute to her the
development of the conversational portrait, as opposed to the
formal frontal or profile portrait.
(1) 부유한 아버지와 재능있는 자매들이 있었다.
(2) 그림 그리기를 포함한 고전 교육을 받았다.
(3) Spain 궁정의 초상화가로서 생계를 유지했다.
(4) Three Sisters Playing Chess에 자신의 자매들을 그렸다.
(5) 당대의 화가 Vasari와 함께 정면 초상화 발전에 기여했다.

38. Science, of course, is an indispensable source of
information for the contemporary writer. It is, furthermore, a
necessary part of his highly technological environment. Thus
it is also an inevitable component of his sensibility and a
decisive, even if often unrecognized, component of his creative
imagination. But science is not in itself an elemental
well-spring of literature. Even the most refined and precise
research data are only raw materials which may or may not
become literature. For whatever becomes a work of art of any
kind does so as a result of an act of creation, an act of artistic
composition, an act involving the art of make-believe.
Scientific statements or remarks as such, even when they are
valid, reliable, and comprehensive, are not literature.

39. One of the common mistakes that employers make is
looking at a team of employees as a homogeneous group that
rises and falls together. Offering incentives, such as a group
bonus or a vacation trip, to a team as a whole is not a smart
managerial move because it fails to acknowledge who an
individual is. For example, sending an entire team to Hawaii
for a job well done actually discourages an employee’s efforts
to do his best work. He only needs to perform well enough
to help achieve the team objective. If, on the other hand, the
employee knew that individual rewards were possible, he
would be more likely to strive to outperform expectations.
While teamwork is important within a corporation, management
should come up with new compensation packages to help
individuals to become champions.

Fortunately, one of the most sustained research programs
in postwar musicology has succeeded in reconstructing their
original sequence.
Beethoven took scraps of paper with him on his frequent
walks, writing down his musical ideas as they came to him.
( (1) ) At home, he kept large sketchbooks into which he
might copy the results or enter new ideas, fashioning and
refashioning the music, crossing it out and starting again.
( (2) ) After Beethoven’s death these sketchbooks were
scattered and in many cases broken up. ( (3) ) As a
result, you can work through them and trace the painful
process by which Beethoven edged toward the music that
we know. ( (4) ) For instance, while the first section of
the ‘Ode to Joy’ seems to have come to him with little
difficulty, the middle section gave him enormous trouble;
there is sketch upon sketch in which Beethoven tries one
idea, then another. ( (5) ) And you find that the most
characteristic and expressive features of the music come
together only during the final stages of the compositional
process.

41. Many theatergoers have been offered lots of good plays
including West Side Story, The King and I, and Dracula for
several decades. However, they have hardly ever seen new
works recently because many producers have avoided making
a new play. Part of the reason may be the tremendous cost
of making a new production these days. It is true that many
producers asked to invest a few hundred thousand dollars in
a production have preferred a play of proven merit and past
success to a new, untried play. That sounds like a reasonable
excuse but, in fact, this practice can lead to an undesirable
situation. Unless new plays are given a chance today, there
will be nothing to revive in the future.

42. If you compare a walnut with some of the beautiful and
exciting things that grow on our planet, it does not seem to
be a marvelous creation. It is common, rough, not
particularly attractive, and certainly not of much value.
Besides, it is small. Its growth is limited by the hard shell
that surrounds it―the shell from which it never escapes
during its lifetime. Of course, that is the wrong way to judge
a walnut. Break one open and look inside. See how the
walnut has grown to fill every corner available to it. It had
no say in the size or shape of that shell. However, given
those limitations, it achieved its full growth. How lucky we
will be if, like the walnut, we blossom and bloom in every
aspect of the life that is given us. Take heart! If one nut can
do it, so can you.

Jim performed fieldwork in Lesotho, a small nation
in Africa. There, studying and interacting with local
villagers, he patiently earned their trust until one day
he was asked to join in one of their songs.
(A) The villagers found his response puzzling. They just
stared at Jim and said, “What do you mean you don’t
sing? You talk!” Jim recalls later, “It was as odd to
them as if I told them that I couldn’t walk or dance,
even though I have both my legs.”
(B) Jim replied in a soft voice, “I don’t sing,” and it was
true. Although he was an excellent oboe player, he was
unable to sing a simple melody.
(C) That’s because singing and dancing were a natural
activity in their lives, involving everyone. Their word
for singing, ho bina, also means ‘to dance’; there is no
distinction, since it is assumed that singing involves
bodily movement.

And also in a moment his heart responded thrillingly to
this novel mood. An instantaneous and strong impulse
moved him to battle with his desperate fate. He would
pull himself out of despair; he would make a man of
himself again; he would conquer the evil that had taken
possession of him. There was time; he was comparatively
young yet: he would revive his old eager ambitions and
pursue them without faltering. Those solemn but sweet
organ notes had set up a revolution in him. Tomorrow he
would go into the roaring downtown district and find
work. A fur importer had once offered him a place as
driver. He would find him tomorrow and ask for the
position. He would be somebody in the world.

If someone were to say “Life is a cup of coffee,” it is
unlikely that you would have heard this expression
before. But its novelty forces you to think about its
meaning. The vehicle used, a cup of coffee, is a common
object of everyday life and therefore easily perceivable as
a source for thinking about that life. The metaphor
compels you to start thinking of life in terms of the
kinds of physical, social, and other attributes that are
associated with a cup of coffee. For this metaphor to
gain currency, however, it must capture the fancy of
many other people for a period of time. Then and only
then will its novelty have become worn out and will it
become the basis for a new conceptual metaphor: life is
a drinking substance. After that, expressions such as
“life is a cup of tea, life is a bottle of beer, life is a glass
of milk,” will become similarly understandable as
offering different perspectives on life.

A new metaphor initially makes people (A) its
meaning; if it loses its novelty later by gaining (B) ,
it will give birth to similar types of metaphorical expressions.

(A)
Sometimes, someone saying you can’t do something is
good for you. It builds mental toughness and conviction.
I often tell people, “Anyone with young children will
tell you, if you ask them not to do something, they’re
guaranteed to do it.” The following story is an example
of how my dad used this to (a) his (and ultimately my)
advantage.
(B)
I was so annoyed and upset by (b) his response that I
worked tirelessly for the remainder of the school year. In
those critical few months I worked so hard that I ended
up winning three awards at the end of year prize-giving.
The best part was being able to tell my dad that I’d
been awarded a place at college. On hearing this news,
he simply lowered his newspaper and, with a smile, said,
“Well done, I always knew you would.” At that moment,
I realized what (c) he had done by ‘discouraging’ me.
(C)
This was my first experience of ‘reverse psychology.’
Some people might say it’s a risky strategy, but it has
certainly worked for me. It has been extremely valuable in
my life, giving me the confidence, determination and
motivation to succeed, even when the odds are stacked
against me. Now as a father myself, I sometimes use the
same technique to motivate my own son. Often enough,
he ends up with favorable results. I just hope one day
(d) he also realizes that I had his best interests in mind.
(D)
As a child I wasn’t particularly academic or ambitious,
and certainly didn’t work very hard at my studies. It
wasn’t until I was coming to the end of the eleventh
grade―and facing the prospect of leaving school without
any sense of what I wanted to do as a career―that I
decided to apply to the local college to pursue further
study. Feeling pleased with myself for having made this
monumental decision, I proudly announced my plan to
my dad. (e) His immediate reaction was to say, “You’ll
never do that. They’ll never accept you.”

[49～50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Serafina Vinon, a seventy-six-year-old woman from the
Italian Alps, still gets up at five in the morning to milk her
cows. Afterward she cooks a huge breakfast, cleans the
house, and depending on the weather and time of year,
either takes the herd to the meadow, tends the orchard, or
cards some wool. In summer she spends weeks on the high
pastures cutting hay and then carries huge piles of it on her
head the several miles down to the barn. She could reach
the barn in half the time if she took a direct route, but she
prefers following invisible winding trails to save the slopes
from erosion.
When Serafina was asked what she enjoys doing most in
life, she had no trouble answering: milking the cows, taking
them to the pasture, tending the orchard, carding wool. In
effect what she enjoys most is what she has been doing for
a living all along. In her own words, “It gives me a great
satisfaction to be outdoors, to talk with people, and to be
with my animals. I talk to everybody―plants, birds, flowers,
and animals. Everything in nature keeps you company; you
see nature progress every day.”
When she was asked what she would do if she had all
the time and money in the world, Serafina laughed―and
repeated the same list of activities. It is not that Serafina is
ignorant of the alternatives offered by urban life. She
watches television occasionally and reads newsmagazines.
But their more fashionable and modern way of life does
not attract Serafina; she is ________________ the role she
plays in the universe.

Geothermal heat, generated inside the Earth, helps keep the
temperature of the ground at a depth of several meters at a
nearly constant temperature of about 10°C to 20°C. (1) This
constant temperature can be used to cool and heat buildings
by using a heat pump. (2) A heat pump contains a water-filled
loop of pipe, which is buried to a depth where the temperature
is nearly constant. (3) In summer, warm water from the
building is pumped through the pipe down into the ground,
since the underground temperature is lower than the air
temperature. (4) However, far more use is made of geothermal
energy for direct heat than any other source of energy. (5) The
water cools and then is pumped back to the building where
it absorbs more heat, and the cycle is repeated.

Comparing yourself with others is natural and can be

especially if you’re ungenerous toward yourself. Instead, try
measuring your present self against your past self. When I
asked a salesperson to map his sales performance, he was
amazed to see that he had achieved a 5% to 10% annual
increase in sales while at his firm. This made him feel more
self-confident and lessened his resentment toward his

successes.

25. Errors and failures typically corrupt all human designs.
Indeed, the failure of a single component of your car’s engine
could force you to call for a tow truck. Similarly, a tiny
wiring error in your computer’s circuits can mean throwing
the whole computer out. Natural systems are different,
though. Throughout Earth’s history, an estimated 3 million
to 100 million species have disappeared, which means that
this year somewhere between three and a hundred species
will vanish. However, such natural extinctions appear to
cause little harm. Over millions of years the ecosystem has
developed an amazing ___________ to errors and failures,

Yucatan meteorite, which killed tens of thousands of species.

26. Unlike deviance in other settings, deviance in sports often
involves ___________________ norms and expectations.
For example, most North Americans see playing football as
a positive activity. Young men are encouraged to ‘be all
they can be’ as football players and to live by slogans such
as “There is no ‘I’ in t-e-a-m.” They are encouraged to
increase their weight and strength, so that they can play
more effectively and contribute to the success of their
teams. When young men go too far in their acceptance of
expectations to become bigger and stronger, when they are
so committed to playing football and improving their skills
on the field that they use muscle-building drugs, they become
deviant. This type of ‘overdoing-it-deviance’ is dangerous,
but it is grounded in completely different social dynamics
from the dynamics that occur in the ‘antisocial deviance’
enacted by alienated young people who reject commonly
accepted rules and expectations.
(1) a disciplined control of the desire to avoid
(2) wasted efforts and resources in establishing
(3) ambitious attempts to get independent of and free from
(4) a traditional approach of matching slogans and mottos with
(5) an unquestioned acceptance of and extreme conformity to
27. Time pressure leads to frustration, and when we are frustrated
or experience other negative emotions, our thinking becomes
narrower and less creative. However, people are unaware of
this phenomenon and live under the illusion that when they
are experiencing time pressure, they are also more creative.
This explains why time pressure is pervasive and to some
extent accounts for the increase in rates of depression. We are
generally too busy trying to squeeze more and more activities
into less and less time. Consequently, we fail to enjoy potential
sources of happiness that may be all around us. To enjoy the
richness that life has to offer, ________________________.
(1) we need to take our time
(2) we should maximize our opportunities
(3) we have to deal with depression wisely
(4) it is necessary to explore some creative ideas
(5) it is important to embrace even negative emotions
28. With no attempt there can be no failure and with no
failure no humiliation. So our self-esteem in this world
depends entirely on what we back ourselves to be and do.
It is determined by the ratio of our actualities to our supposed
potentialities. Thus, ________________________________.
This illustrates how every rise in our levels of expectation
entails a rise in the dangers of humiliation. What we
understand to be normal is critical in determining our chances
of happiness. It also hints at two ways for raising our
self-esteem. On the one hand, we may try to achieve more;
and on the other, we may reduce the number of things we
want to achieve. The advantages of the latter approach lie in
the following statement: To give up pretensions is as blessed
a relief as to get them gratified. [3점]
(1) the higher your expectations are, the more you will achieve
(2) self-esteem can be increased by lowering actualities
(3) success divided by pretensions equals self-esteem
(4) early failures in life may lead to happiness later in life
(5) more supposed potentialities increase chances of happiness
29. For many people ‘nature’ is defined as a negative: It exists
where people do not. Nature lies outside the urban and
agricultural realms, in regions of Earth where natural
processes are unhindered. Nature is where fallen logs rot and
acorns grow, wildfires turn woodlands into meadows, and
barrier islands shift with the currents ― all without human
interference. By extension, this definition suggests that nature
is best protected by keeping humans far away, so that it can
continue to run itself. But there is a serious problem with this
view. If nature is defined as a landscape uninfluenced by
humankind, then __________________________. Prehistoric
peoples changed their surrounding ecosystems, whether by
installing orchards in the Amazon or by hunting many large
mammals to extinction in North America. And modern
humans are changing the global environment even more
profoundly, whether through planet-wide climate change, or
by the worldwide movement of synthetic chemicals through
the food chain.
(1) humans cannot exist without nature
(2) there is no nature on the planet at all
(3) it deserves to be preserved at all costs
(4) modern people owe much to their ancestors

capacity for rational thought. This is an uncontested necessary
condition for any form of moral agency, since we all
accept that people who are incapable of reasoned thought
cannot be held morally responsible for their actions.
However, if we move beyond this uncontroversial salient
feature of moral agents, then the most salient feature of
actual flesh-and-blood (as opposed to ridiculously idealized)
individual moral agents is surely the fact that every moral
agent __________________________________ every moral
problem situation. That is, there is no one-size-fits-all answer
to the question “What are the basic ways in which moral
agents wish to affect others?” Rather, moral agents wish to
affect ‘others’ in different ways depending upon who these
‘others’ are.

It is said that although people laugh in the same way, they

single community, it is even more true of people who live in
different societies, because the topics that people find amusing,
and the occasions that are regarded as (1)appropriate for joking,
can vary enormously from one society to the next. Some styles
of humor with silly actions are guaranteed to raise a laugh
everywhere. But because of their reliance on shared assumptions,
most jokes travel very (2)well. This is particularly (3)noticeable
in the case of jokes that involve a play on words. They are
difficult, and in some cases virtually (4) impossible to translate

34. While predictions about the future are always difficult,
one can be made with certainty. People will find themselves
in large numbers of interactions where intercultural
communication skills will be essential. There are several
reasons for such prediction. Some reasons include increasing
amounts of contact brought on by overseas assignments in
the business world, the movement of college students
spending time in other countries, and increasing amounts of
international travel among tourists. Others relate to social
changes within any one large and complex nation: affirmative
action, the movement of immigrants and refugees, bilingual
education programs, and movement away from the goal that
ethnic minorities become a part of a ‘melting pot.’ Therefore,
it is essential that people research the cultures and
communication conventions of those whom they propose to
meet in the future.

35. A famous psychiatrist was leading a symposium on the
methods of getting patients to open up about themselves. The
psychiatrist challenged his colleagues with a boast: “I’ll bet
that my technique will enable me to get a new patient to talk
about the most private things during the first session without
my having to ask a question.” What was his magic formula?
Simply this: He began the session by revealing to the patient
something personal about himself ― secrets with which the
patient might damage the doctor by breaking the confidence.
As he was ‘maskless,’ patients began to talk about their lives.
They opened themselves up to him because he had become
an open-minded person himself, and openness evoked
openness. The same principle applies to all human relationships.
If you dare to take the initiative in self-revelation, the other
person is much more likely to reveal secrets to you.

(2) opening up oneself to draw out the other person
(3) need of confidentiality between doctors and patients

During the early 1980s, a team of Italian scientists carried
out a series of studies under a variety of circumstances on
the ticklishness of people. The researchers found that
people seem to have one foot that is more ticklish than the
other ― and for most people it is the right. The experiment
was repeated in 1998 using a special way that a pointed
nylon rod was stroked across the bottom of the foot three
times at intervals of a second. After applying it to thirty-four
people, the researchers confirmed the original finding and
pushed back the frontiers of knowledge still further by
showing that males were more ticklish than females. One
suggested explanation is that the left side of the brain,
which detects stimuli applied to the right foot, is associated
with positive emotions such as laughter.

Buffon was a famous zoologist and botanist during the
reign of the French monarch Louis ⅩⅥ. Buffon stocked the
park at Versailles with wild animals. He also expanded the
botanical garden on the Left Bank in Paris. And with the
confidence that goes with being a great collector, he began
writing a comprehensive natural history of the world. In
that work, Buffon expressed the biased opinion that native
animals of the New World are smaller than those of
Europe, that there are fewer species of animals in America,
and that even domesticated species of European animals
diminished in size and vigor upon crossing the Atlantic.
Obviously, his opinions were not well-received and were
severely criticized in America.

39. After an event, all one has are memories of it. Because
most waits expect a desired outcome, it is the memory of the
outcome that dominates, not the intermediate components. If
the overall outcome is pleasurable enough, any unpleasantness
suffered along the way is minimized. Terence Mitchell and
Leigh Thompson call this ‘rosy retrospection.’ Mitchell and
his colleagues studied participants in a 12-day tour of Europe,
students going home for Thanksgiving vacation and a
three-week bicycle tour across California. In all of these cases,
the results were similar. Before an event, people looked
forward with positive anticipation. Afterward, they remembered
fondly. During? Well, reality seldom lives up to expectations,
so plenty of things go wrong. As memory takes over, however,
the unpleasantness fades and the good parts remain, perhaps
to intensify, and even get amplified beyond reality.

40. Every day, it seems, we learn of an apology from a
prominent figure in response to an indiscretion of some sort.
Those in the public eye have an unfortunate tendency to
apologize only after they have been found with a hand in the
cookie jar. When this happens, it is only natural for a
skeptical public to wonder, “Are they apologizing for their
conduct, or simply because they were caught?” To make
matters worse, the wrongdoer will often use the passive voice
in his or her apology: “Mistakes were made,” rather than, “I
made a mistake.” It is more comfortable to use the passive
voice here, but doing so relinquishes any sense of personal
responsibility. It is a non-apology and is not very meaningful.

41. We can infer that there was prosperity in ancient Athens
because this was a time that saw the planting of many olive
trees. Since olive trees do not produce their fruits for about
thirty years, their planting indicates that people were
optimistic about the future. The growth in the export of olive
oil also encouraged the development of pottery, in which the
oil was transported. About 535 B.C. came the invention of
red-figure vase painting. Now the whole surface of the vase
was blackened, with figures picked out in the natural red.
This allowed much more variety and realism. And the
prosperity brought about by the international trade in olive
oil spread to the peasants and it was their rituals, with choral
song and mimic dancing, that formed the basis of early
theater.

42. Until recently, it was generally assumed that the first
humans took a northerly route to leave the African continent,
walking into the Middle East and then spreading out from
there. However, mtDNA analysis now suggests the exodus
may have proceeded via a more southerly route. In 2005, an
international team of researchers announced that an isolated
group living in Malaysia appeared to be the descendants of
humans who left Africa around 65,000 years ago. According
to the researchers, climatic change underway at the time
would have made a southerly route easier. The genetic
evidence suggests perhaps as few as several hundred
individuals went first to India, then Southeast Asia and
Australasia. If correct, this would explain why humans
appear to have reached Australia around 50,000 years ago,
while the oldest human remains in Europe ― a jawbone
found in Romania ― are only around 35,000 years old.

Even worse than reaching a conclusion with just a
little evidence is the fallacy of reaching a conclusion
without any evidence at all. Sometimes people mistake
a separate event for a cause-and-effect relationship.
(A) You therefore leap to the conclusion that the man in

leap tends to land far from the truth of the matter. You
have absolutely no evidence ― only a suspicion based

The information processing model emphasizes rational
analysis for solving problems, with an emphasis on
techniques for quickly arriving at a solution. Culturally, this
orientation fits well with the kinds of mental attributes which
are normally valued by contemporary Western societies. For
example, Westerners tend to admire someone who is
independent and quick-thinking. But these characteristics are
not universally valued. Agricultural African societies, for
example, valued looking at the problem in the context of the
whole society, noting its impact on various features of life.
In most situations, speed in arriving at a solution was not a
vital issue. This is also found with the Cree and Ojibway in
Canada. These groups historically lived in wilderness areas
and faced many hardships; in these circumstances, they
would rarely get a second chance at solving problems.
Consequently, these Native people value taking time to
reflect on a problem and mentally walk through possible
solutions before any action is taken.

The other day an acquaintance of mine, a sociable and
charming man, told me he had found himself unexpectedly
‘alone’ in New York for an hour or two between appointments.
He went to the Whitney Museum and spent the ‘empty’
time looking at things by himself. For him it proved to be
a shock nearly as great as falling in love to discover that
he could enjoy himself so much alone.
What had he been afraid of? I asked myself. That,
suddenly alone, he would discover that he bored himself,
or that there was, quite simply, no self there to meet? But
having taken the first step into this new world, he is now
about to begin a new adventure; he is about to be launched
into his own inner space, space as immense, unexplored,
and sometimes frightening as outer space to the astronaut.
His every perception will come to him with a new freshness
and, for a time, seem startlingly __________. For anyone
who can see things for himself with a naked eye becomes,
for a moment or two, something of a genius. With another
human being present vision becomes double vision, inevitably.
We are busy wondering, what does my companion see or

(A)
My grandmother’s kitchen was overflowing with food.
She raised her daughters to keep an extra box and bottle
unopened in the cupboard for every bottle and box that was
in use. Although she died before I was born, I was raised
by her eldest daughter to do this same thing. Absentminded
as I am, I often find I have accumulated two or even three
extras of anything in my house.
(B)
Befriending life is not always about having things your
own way. Life is impermanent and full of broken eggs. But
what is true of eggs is even more true of pain and loss and
suffering. Certain things are too important to be wasted.
When I was sixteen, just after the doctor came and informed
me that I had a disease that no one knew how to cure, my
mother had reminded me of this.
(C)
But this abundance did not mean that things were to be
wasted. Everything was always used to the full. Even the
tea bags were used twice. There is a family story told about
my grandmother’s refrigerator. Her refrigerator was always
full to the very edges and every shelf was put to use.
Occasionally when someone, usually a child, opened it
without sufficient caution, an egg would fall out and break
on the kitchen floor. My grandmother’s response was always
the same. She would look at the broken egg with satisfaction.
“Aha,” she would say, “today we have a sponge cake!”
(D)
I had turned toward her in shock, but she did not cuddle
or soothe. Instead she reached out and took me by the hand.
“We will make a sponge cake,” she told me firmly. It has taken
many years to find the recipe, the one that is my own, but
I knew in that moment that this was what I needed to do.

Consider the following implication involving the role of
social bonds and affection among group members. If strong
bonds make even a single dissent less likely, the performance
of groups and institutions will be impaired. (1) A study of
investment clubs showed that the worst-performing clubs
were built on affective ties and were primarily social, while
the best-performing clubs limited social connections and
focused on making money. (2) Dissent was far more frequent
in the high-performing clubs. (3) The low performers usually
voted unanimously, with little open debate. (4) As illustrated
in the study, the high performers placed more importance on
social bonds than the low performers, resulting in their high
rate of success. (5) The central problem is that the voters in
low-performing groups were trying to build social cohesion
rather than to produce the highest returns.

I have always taught my children that politeness, learning,
and order are good things, and that something good is to be
desired and developed for its own sake. But at school they
learned, and very quickly, that children earn Nature Trail
tickets for running the quarter-mile track during lunch
recess. Or Lincoln Dollars for picking up trash on the
playground or for helping a young child find the bathroom
― deeds that used to be called ‘good citizenship.’ Why is
it necessary to buy the minimal cooperation of children with
rewards and treats? What disturbs me is the idea that good
behavior must be reinforced with incentives. Children must

24. In a classic set of studies over a ten-year period, biologist
Gerald Wilkinson found that, when vampire bats return to
their communal nests from a successful night’s foraging, they
frequently vomit blood and share it with other nest-mates,
including even non-relatives. The reason, it turns out, is that
blood-sharing greatly improves each bat’s chances of survival.
A bat that fails to feed for two nights is likely to die.
Wilkinson showed that the blood donors are typically sharing
their surpluses and, in so doing, are saving unsuccessful
foragers that are close to starvation. So the costs are
relatively low and the benefits are relatively high. Since no
bat can be certain of success on any given night, it is likely
that the donor will itself eventually need help from some
nest-mate. In effect, the vampire bats have created a kind

25. One of the little understood paradoxes in communication
is that the more difficult the word, the shorter the
explanation. The more meaning you can pack into a single
word, the fewer words are needed to get the idea across. Big
words are resented by persons who don’t understand them
and, of course, very often they are used to confuse and
impress rather than clarify. But this is not the fault of
language; it is the arrogance of the individual who misuses
the tools of communication. The best reason for acquiring a
large vocabulary is that . A genuinely
educated person can express himself tersely and trimly. For
example, if you don’t know, or use, the word ‘imbricate,’
you have to say to someone, ‘having the edges overlapping
in a regular arrangement like tiles on a roof, scales on a
fish, or sepals on a plant.’ More than 20 words to say what
can be said in one.
(1) it keeps you from being long-winded
(2) you can avoid critical misunderstandings
(3) it enables you to hide your true intentions
(4) it makes you express yourself more impressively
(5) you can use an easy word instead of a difficult one
26. So far as you are wholly concentrated on bringing about
a certain result, clearly the quicker and easier it is brought
about the better. Your resolve to secure a sufficiency of
food for yourself and your family will induce you to spend
weary days in tilling the ground and tending livestock; but
if Nature provided food and meat in abundance ready for
the table, you would thank Nature for sparing you much
labor and consider yourself so much the better off. An
executed purpose, in short, is a transaction in which the time
and energy spent on the execution are balanced against the
resulting assets, and the ideal case is one in which
. Purpose, then, justifies the
efforts it exacts only conditionally, by their fruits. [3점]
(1) demand exceeds supply, resulting in greater returns
(2) life becomes fruitful with our endless pursuit of dreams
(3) the time and energy are limitless and assets are abundant
(4) Nature does not reward those who do not exert efforts

27. Psychologist Solomon Asch wanted to discover whether
people’s tendency to agree with their peers was stronger
than their tendency toward independent thought and rational
judgment. Asch assembled groups of twelve university
students and announced that they were taking part in an
experiment on visual perception. He showed them three line
segments, and asked each one in turn which line was the
longest. It was an easy task and the correct answer was
obvious. However, Asch had secretly instructed all but the
last person in each group, who was the real subject of the
experiment, to say that the medium-length line was the
longest. As it turned out, over 70 percent of the real subjects
 and said that the medium-length
line was the longest.
(1) caved in to group pressure
(2) figured out the correct answer
(3) had problems with their vision

28. Journeys are the midwives of thought. Few places are
more conducive to internal conversations than a moving plane,
ship, or train. There is an almost peculiar correlation between
what is in front of our eyes and the thoughts we are able to
have in our heads: large thoughts at times requiring large
views, new thoughts new places. Introspective reflections
which are liable to stall are helped along by the flow of the
landscape. The mind when thinking
is all it is supposed to do. The task can be as paralyzing as
having to tell a joke or mimic an accent on demand. Thinking
improves when parts of the mind are given other tasks, are
charged with listening to music or following a line of trees.

29. It is a fundamental mistake to imagine that when we see
the non-value in a value or the untruth in a truth, the value
or the truth ceases to exist. It has only become relative.
Everything human is relative, because everything rests on
an inner polarity; for everything is a phenomenon of energy.
Energy necessarily depends on a pre-existing polarity, without
which there could be no energy. There must always be high
and low, hot and cold, etc., so that the equilibrating
process ― which is energy ― can take place. Therefore the
tendency to deny all previous values in favor of their
opposites is just . And in so
far as it is a question of rejecting universally accepted and
indubitable values, the result is a fatal loss. [3점]
(1) another way of pursuing relativeness in human affairs
(2) as desirable as the tendency to accept all those values
(3) as much of an exaggeration as the earlier onesidedness
(4) the one and only way of approaching the ultimate truth
(5) to admit the presence of energy derived from an inner polarity

Jess took another step forward. The ground fell with
unexpected sharpness, and the water level seemed to jump
from her knees to her waist. She stopped for a moment and
anxiously scanned the river before her. Her legs started to
shake and she felt her body stiffen. And this was an
unknown river. There could be reeds, or other dangers she
didn’t know about. She was concerned that as a townie,
she’d had little experience of the countryside, and none at
all of swimming in rivers. It didn’t look safe enough but she
didn’t want to turn back. She took a deep breath and pushed
herself into the water. It felt nice and cool, not as freezing
as when she had first stepped into it. The water seemed to
welcome and embrace her. She liked the clean, luxuriant
feeling as she swept down with the current.

34. Experienced writers invariably write in a climate of
discussion. Their writing is usually embedded in a context
of others’ ideas and opinions. Many writers, especially in
the academic community, are directly responding to other
writers ―a scientist reexamining the experimental procedures
of other scientists; a literary critic taking exception to a
prevailing method of interpretation; a sociologist offering
an alternative explanation of a colleague’s data; a historian
participating as respondent in a conference. Such people
are not writing in a vacuum. Their ideas often originate in
discussion, their writing is a response to discussion, and
their papers are designed to stimulate further discussion.

life exists. Each habitat is the home of numerous species,
most of which depend on that habitat. When it disappears,
a vast number of species disappear as well. More often, an
entire habitat does not completely disappear but instead is
reduced gradually until only small patches remain. This
has happened to old-growth forests and coastal wetlands in
the United States and is now occurring in tropical forests
throughout the world. Elimination of all but small patches of
habitat is especially damaging because it not only eliminates
many local species but also threatens those species that
depend on vast acreage for their survival.

Around 350 B.C. there lived in Greece a very famous
painter named Apelles. It was his practice to conceal
himself at previews of his paintings in order to hear the
public’s opinions of his masterpieces. At one such preview
a bootmaker criticized the shoes in a painting on which
Apelles had labored long and hard. After correcting the
picture the painter arranged a second preview. This time
the bootmaker began to criticize the anatomy of one of the
characters. Apelles was unable to restrain himself, for he
knew that the criticism was unjust and the man knew
nothing about anatomy. From his hiding place Apelles
shouted, “Bootmaker, stick to your last!” From that time it
has been the custom to ridicule the people who act like
they know what they do not with the pointed caution,
“Stick to your last!”

Bristlecone pines are unusual trees that grow in the
mountain regions of western America, sometimes as high
as two or more miles above sea level. They grow very
slowly and range from 15 to 40 feet in height. These
evergreens often live for thousands of years. Considering
the habitat of these trees, such as rocky areas where the soil
is poor and precipitation is slight, it seems almost incredible
that they should live so long or even survive at all. The
environmental adversities, however, actually contribute to
their longevity. Cells that are produced as a result of these
conditions are densely arranged. The densely structured
wood is resistant to invasion by insects and other potential
pests. Bristlecone pines grow faster in richer conditions,
but die earlier and soon decay. The harshness of their
surroundings, then, is a vital factor in making them strong
and sturdy.

39. Most people attack a new problem by relying heavily
on the tools and skills that are most familiar to them.
While this approach can work well for problems that are
similar to those previously solved, it often fails, and fails
miserably, when a new problem is particularly novel. In
this circumstance, it is best to assume nothing and treat
the problem as if you have never seen anything like it
before. In martial arts, this sense of looking freshly at
something is known as ‘beginner’s mind.’ Beginners to any
art don’t know what is important and what is irrelevant, so
they try to absorb every detail. Experienced martial artists
use their experience as a filter to separate the essential
from the irrelevant. When that filter mistakenly screens
out something essential, then even seasoned masters can
make mistakes.

When other people fail, you feel there’s a better chance
for you to succeed. However, there is not a limited supply
of resources out there. When one person wins, everyone
wins. Every victory one person makes is a breakthrough
for all. Whenever an Olympic swimmer sets a new world
record, it inspires others to bring out the best within them
and go beyond that achievement to set new records of
human performance. Whenever a geneticist unlocks new

in a circle and each student took turns telling the others
his or her name. At the end of the round of introductions,
the students were asked to write down the names of as
many other students as they could remember. In almost
every case, students wrote down the names of students
that were seated far away from them. However, surprisingly,
they weren’t able to recall the names of students who were
seated close to them. This effect was worst for the students
who sat on either side of them. What was the reason for
such findings? The student who was next in line for an

42. Richard Dawkins and John Krebs argued that although
in some circumstances it might be appropriate to describe
animal signals as transferring information, in many other,
perhaps most, cases there would be such a conflict of
interest between signaller and receiver that it is more accurate
to describe the signaller as attempting to ‘manipulate’ the
receiver rather than just inform it. For example, an angler
fish that dangles a worm-like bit of skin in front of a small
fish and catches it because the smaller fish snaps at the
‘worm’ can certainly be said to have carried out a successful
manipulation of its prey. In this case, if information has
been transferred, it is most definitely false.

Unlike the modern society, the primitive society has
less specialized knowledge to transmit, and since its way
of life is enacted before the eyes of all, it has no need
to create a separate institution of education such as the
school. Instead, the child acquires the heritage of his
culture by observing and imitating adults in such activities
as rituals, hunts, festivals, cultivation, and harvesting.
As a result, there is little or none of that alienation of
young from old so marked in modern industrial societies.
A further reason for this alienation in modern societies
is that in his conception of reality the modern adult owes
less to his direct experience and more to the experience
of his culture than does primitive man. Clearly, his debt
to culture will vary with the nature of his education.
Hence, the contemporary child must travel much further
than the offspring of primitive man to acquire the world
view of his elders. He is, therefore, that much more
removed from the adults of his society.

Many people believe that it is critical to share similar, if
not identical, beliefs and values with someone with whom
they have a relationship. While this may seem preferable, it
is far from mandatory. Individuals from extremely diverse
backgrounds have learned to overlook their differences and
live harmonious, loving lives together. I’ve seen people
from opposite ends of the spectrum economically and
politically that ended up in happy, lasting marriages. I’ve
seen couples from different ethnic groups merge into
harmonious relationships, and I’ve seen people from
different religions come together for a strong, lasting bond.
Furthermore, many good friends have little in common
except a warm loving feeling of respect and rapport.
That’s the only essential thing.
People who enjoy the best relationships with others, who
live life with the least frustration regarding their differences,
have learned that differences are to be expected, a fact of
life. This understanding must go beyond a mere intellectual
‘I know we’re all different.’ You must truly own this idea
and incorporate it into your daily life.
The way I see it, we have only two realistic choices.
We can the principle of separate realities and
remain frustrated and angry over the fact that no one
seems to conform to our way of thinking, or we can
strive to understand what in Eastern philosophy is called
‘the way of things.’ Separate realities is the way things
really are. Everyone is unique and has different gifts to
offer. When we look for these gifts we will surely find
them ― and in doing so, we will open the door to a world
of personal growth. * rapport: 친밀한(공감적인) 관계

After several futile attempts to teach the role of theme,
or the prominent repeated melody, in classical music, the
teacher was at wit’s end. Having reminded her students
many times that composers like Wagner depended on the
listeners’ remembering the earlier theme to recognize its
later use, (a) she was determined to make her students
understand that themes recur throughout a piece.
(B)
She knew that her class had little trouble with simple
variations and could easily identify themes that were
repeated in a similar way. But when the theme showed
much variation, the students’ attention focused on the new
detail to such an extent that they no longer ‘heard’ the
basic theme. For a week or two, the teacher worried about
the problem. Other teachers advised (b) her to go on with
something else, but she continued to search for a solution.
(C)
The following day in class, (c) she asked how many
students had tape recorders. A dozen or so students said,
“I do.” The teacher said excitedly, “I have an idea. Let’s
play Beethoven’s Eroica again. One of you can record the
theme when it’s first introduced. Then later, someone else
can record it the second time it appears. Finally, we’ll
have another person record when it appears next. Then we
can start all three tape recorders at exactly the same time
to see if the recordings fit!” Her students looked at (d) her
in surprise. Suddenly, however, delight appeared on their
faces. And so it was done. When they played the recordings
simultaneously, the sounds blended sufficiently for the
students to recognize their commonality.
(D)
With this problem in mind, one afternoon during the
lunch hour, she noticed a group of students gathered in a
corner of the school yard. Several girls were moving their
bodies rhythmically. Curious, she drew closer and found
that the students were listening to a new rock hit. A girl
in the center of the group held a tape recorder in (e) her
hand. At that moment, a sudden inspiration took hold.
