Everyone would like to assume that their wonderful,
creative ideas will sell themselves. But as Galileo, Edvard
Munch, Toni Morrison, Sylvia Plath, and millions of others
have discovered, they do not. On the contrary, creative ideas
are usually viewed with suspicion and distrust. Thus, students
need to learn how to persuade other people of the value of
their ideas. This selling is part of the practical aspect of
creative thinking. If students do a science project, it is a good
idea for them to present it and demonstrate why it makes an
important contribution. If they develop a plan for a new form
of government, they should explain why it is better than the
existing form of government.
(1) 공정한 판단은 타인의 의견을 경청하는 데서 시작된다.

24. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
In the nineteenth century, a decisive moment occurred when
people in advertising and journalism discovered that if they
framed their stories and appeals with fear, they could capture
our attention. It is an emotion we find hard to resist or control,
and so they constantly shifted our focus to new possible
sources of anxiety: the latest health scare, the new crime
wave, and endless hazards in the environment of which we
were not aware. With the increasing sophistication of the
media and the haunting quality of the imagery, they have been
able to give us the feeling that we are fragile creatures in an
environment full of danger ― even though we live in a world
infinitely safer and more predictable than anything our
ancestors knew. With their help, our anxieties have only
increased.
(1) the crisis of modern journalism
(2) the various sources of human fears
(3) the media’s exploitation of human anxieties
(4) the importance of advertising and journalism
(5) the fragile nature of human life in modern society

In the past, many public-sector recreation providers allowed
people free access or charged for permits to control the
amount or season for different recreational activities such as
fishing or horse-riding. However, governments and other
public agencies are finding that funding to maintain sites and
facilities, to cope with increased demand on the landscape, is
becoming difficult to maintain. Opportunities to charge
visitors for appropriate services to help compensate for these
costs are being considered as one solution. This is a sensitive
matter, as free access for all people to the outdoors is a much
cherished right. There is also an additional dilemma for public
agencies where recreation facilities are already provided from
public money, and it could be argued that the taxpayer is
being charged twice. Thus, care is needed by public bodies to
ensure that charges are only made for services that are clearly
additional to the provision of free access.

Zaynab Fawwaz was born into a poor family in South
Lebanon. As a young girl (1) she went to Alexandria with the
Egyptian family for whom she worked. Her mistress was
intrigued by her maid’s native intelligence and introduced
Zaynab to (2) her literate friend, Fatima. She, in turn, taught
her reading, writing and arithmetic. Zaynab quickly learned
what (3) her teacher had to offer and in time went on to study

in women’s issues and she wrote some pioneering poetry and
essays focused on women’s rights. The most famous of (5) her

Given that music appears to enhance physical and
mental skills, are there circumstances where music is
(1) damaging to performance? One domain (2) which this is of
considerable significance is music’s potentially damaging
effects on the ability to drive safely. Evidence suggests an
association between loud, fast music and reckless driving, but
how might music’s ability to influence driving in this way
(3) be explained? One possibility is that drivers adjust to
temporal regularities in music, and (4) that their speed is
influenced accordingly. In other words, just as faster music
causes people to eat faster, (5) so it causes people to drive at
faster speeds, as they engage mentally and physically with
ongoing repeated structures in the music.

England’s plan to establish colonies in North America,
starting in the late sixteenth century, was founded on a
(A) false / valid idea. It was generally assumed that Virginia,
the region of the North American continent to which
England laid claim, would have the same climate as the
Mediterranean region of Europe, since it lay at similar
latitudes. As a result, the English hoped that the American
colonies, once established, would be able to supply
Mediterranean goods such as olives and fruit and reduce England’s
(B) dependence / restriction on imports from continental Europe.
One prospectus claimed that the colonies would provide “the
wines, fruit and salt of France and Spain ... the silks of Persia
and Italy.” Similarly, (C) abundant / scarce timber would do
away with the need to import wood from Scandinavia. In
short, America was mistakenly expected to be a land of plenty
that would quickly turn a profit.

The above graph shows the comparison between the
allocated budget and actual spending for six departments at
Triton Ventures in 2012. (1) The Customer Service department
was allocated 60,000 dollars, which was greater than the
amount allocated to any other department. (2) On the other
hand, in terms of actual spending, the top two departments
that spent the most were Marketing and Development. (3) The
Customer Service and Information Technology departments
spent the same amount of money, which was 20,000 dollars.
(4) The actual spending by the Administration department was
less than half the allocated budget. (5) The Sales department
showed the largest gap between the allocated budget and its
actual spending among the six departments.
30. Georgia O’Keeffe에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는
것은?
In her art, Georgia O’Keeffe clearly showed a pioneering
spirit and an intensely individual style. At age twenty-seven,
while teaching art in South Carolina, O’Keeffe began a series
of simple, abstract charcoal drawings that expressed her own
ideas and feelings. She sent these drawings to a friend in New
York, who showed them to Alfred Stieglitz, the owner of the
influential gallery 291. Stieglitz hailed them as the “purest,
finest, sincerest things.” O’Keeffe’s greatest source of
inspiration was nature. Her best-known paintings are large,
extreme close-ups of flowers; the simplified and magnified
views compel us to look at them in a new way and to discover
their inner essence. At the same time, the paintings become
abstract arrangements of color and line, light and shadow.
While in New Mexico, she was also fascinated by the simple
geometric grace of adobe churches and the majesty of the
desert.
* adobe: 흙을 재료로 한 건축 양식의 일종
(1) 27세에 South Carolina에서 미술을 가르쳤다.
(2) 자신의 드로잉 작품들을 Stieglitz에게 보냈다.
(3) 영감을 얻은 가장 큰 원천은 자연이었다.
(4) 가장 잘 알려진 그림들은 클로즈업한 꽃 그림이다.
(5) New Mexico에서 사막의 장엄함에 매료되었다.

31. Appearance creates the first impression customers have of
food, and first impressions are important. No matter how
appealing the taste, an unattractive appearance is hard to
overlook. As humans, we do “eat with our eyes” because our
sense of sight is more highly developed than the other senses.
The sense of sight is so highly developed in humans that
messages received from other senses are often ignored if they
conflict with what is seen. Yellow candy is expected to be
lemon-flavored, and if it is grape-flavored, many people

32. The Rust Belt is notorious for its poor air quality. For
decades, coal plants, steel production, and auto emissions
have pumped particulates like sulfate into the atmosphere over
the eastern U.S. Especially before air quality laws began
appearing in the 1970s, particulate pollution was behind acid
rain, respiratory disease, and ozone depletion. But a new study
from Harvard University suggests that the Rust Belt’s thick
particulate fog may have helped slow down the effects of
climate change, particularly when it was thickest. Throughout
the 20th century, global temperatures have gone up by just
under one degree Celsius. But in the U.S., eastern and central
states haven’t seen the same rise. In fact, temperatures there
actually decreased over the same period. The reason seems to
be particulate pollution. Instead of trapping warm air in the
atmosphere like carbon dioxide, fine particles like sulfate
reflect the sun’s light and heat. They may even group with
watery cloud droplets, which do the same thing. The effect
is .
* particulate: 분진, 미립 물질
(1) an accumulation of carbon dioxide
(2) a net cooling across entire regions
(3) a steep acceleration of global warming
(4) a significant improvement in air quality
(5) a slow but steady increase in temperatures
33. Suppose a survivor from an airplane crash with severe
injuries struggles for days through the jungle but dies just
before reaching a village. It is tempting to think “if only he had
managed to walk to the village, he would have been rescued.”
But suppose you must try to console the victim’s relatives.
What might you say? Or suppose you wish to defend the
rescue team who got as far as the village but no further.
Your motivation to console or defend may influence the
alternative you imagine. You may decide to emphasize the
severity of the victim’s injuries and suggest “even if he had
managed to walk to the village, he still would have died.”
Sometimes thoughts about what might have been change an
antecedent event (the victim walked to the village) but leave
the outcome unchanged (he still died). “Even if...”
conditionals have been called “semifactual” because they
combine a counterfactual antecedent and a factual consequence.
Imagined semifactual alternatives are intriguing because,
unlike other thoughts about what might have been, they
suggest that . [3점]
(1) the consequence is unimaginable
(2) the antecedent is inevitable
(3) the outcome is inevitable
(4) the antecedent is unpredictable
(5) the consequence is unpredictable
34. The so-called Mozart effect ― listening to Mozart will
make your child smarter ― is a good example of
by the media
through hype not warranted by the research. It all started when
researchers reported that after exposure to a selection of
Mozart’s music, college students showed an increase in spatial
reasoning for about 10 minutes on tasks like putting together
pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Note first that the research was done
on college students, not infants, and that the effect was very
brief. In addition, no one’s been able to replicate the research.
The increase in spatial reasoning, it turns out, can be generated
by any auditory stimulation (e.g., listening to a short story or
other types of music) that keeps people alert while being tested.
However, none of this has stopped eager parents ― spurred on
by fantastic claims from unethical companies ― from
purchasing Mozart CDs for their babies. [3점]
* hype: 과대 광고(선전)
(1) the bond between parents and children exaggerated
(2) a genuine scientific innovation being discarded
(3) a scientific finding being distorted
(4) the correlation between reasoning and music being rejected
(5) the convergence of music and physiology made possible

35. As the structures of our world and the conditions of
certainty have yielded to an avalanche of change, the
extent of our longing for stable, definitive leadership
. The fault
lies not with leadership but rather with ourselves and our
expectations. In the old days, leaders were supposed to
make sense of chaos, to make certainty out of doubt, and
to create positive action plans for the resolution of
paradoxes. Good leaders straightened things out. Should
chaos rear its ugly head, the leader was expected to restore
normality immediately. But chaos is now considered
normal, paradoxes cannot be resolved, and certainty is
possible only to the level of high probability. Leadership
that attempts to deliver in terms of fixing any of these can
only fail. And that is exactly what is happening. [3점]
* an avalanche of: 많은, 쇄도하는
(1) can only be measured by our will to establish it
(2) has made traditional leadership more irreplaceable
(3) can create viable action plans for restoring normality
(4) has vastly reduced the probability of resolving paradoxes
(5) has been exceeded only by the impossibility of finding it

competitors typically go on the defensive, doing whatever
they can to (A) the odds that the offering will eat
into their sales. Responses might include increasing marketing
efforts, offering discounts to channel partners, and even
lobbying for regulations that would hinder the rival’s
expansion. In many cases, though, such actions are misguided.
Although the conventional wisdom that a rival’s launch will
hurt profits is often correct, my research shows that
companies sometimes see profits increase after a rival’s
launch. The underlying mechanism is pretty simple: When a
company comes out with a new product, it often raises the
prices of its existing products. This might be designed to
make the new product look (B) and thus more
attractive by comparison. As that company adjusts its pricing,
its competitors can do the same without risking customer
defections over price. [3점]

37. All human societies have economic systems within which
goods and services are produced, distributed, and consumed.
In one sense, the economic aspect of culture is simply the sum
of the choices people make regarding these areas of their
lives. These choices critically determine much of people’s
lives. (A) , choosing to become a farmer rather
than an insurance broker may determine where you live, who
you are likely to meet, the sorts of behaviors you will expect
in your spouse and offspring, and so on. However, such
choices are not unlimited; rather, they are limited by our
cultures, traditions, and technologies. (B) , our
environments set the boundaries within which choices about
the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and
services are made. To the extent that economic systems are
part of culture, people in different cultures have different sorts
of economic behavior.

Organic farmers grow crops that are no less plagued by
pests than those of conventional farmers; insects generally
do not discriminate between organic and conventional as
well as we do.
(A) However, most organic farmers have no choice but to rely
on chemicals as necessary supplements to their operations.
With pests often consuming up to 40 percent of the crops
grown in the United States, they do so as a matter of
course.
(B) They might refer to these substances as “botanical
extracts.” But according to Ned Groth, a senior scientist
at Consumers Union, these toxins “are not necessarily
less worrisome because they are natural.”
(C) It is true that they are far more likely than conventional
farmers to practice environmentally beneficial forms of
biological control, and that they are also more likely to
sensibly diversify their crops to reduce infestation.

But the ones in which he could get up and do things like

A narrative is not a myth the first time it is told, but only a
story or an account. What makes a story a myth is the fact
that it is received by a given society and that a given society
participates in its transmission. Obviously, it is difficult to
determine just when any story becomes a myth, but it is
clear that a narrative is not a myth when it is first told. The
intentions of the first narrator and the last narrator can be
the same, but this still does not give any special status to the
creator of a myth. It is far more important to realize that the
intentions of a given society in transmitting a narrative may
have nothing to do with the purposes of its author. Thus we
can never identify any individual creator of a myth. So long
as myth is a collective narrative by definition, the only
relevant consideration are the mentality and purposes of the
society for which the myth is a myth.

Carrying capacity is the number of individuals that the
local resources can sustain. Individuals in a population that
has exceeded the carrying capacity of its habitat may have
poor health and suffer from malnutrition because of the
compromised living conditions. When this happens, the
weakest individuals may die, or the population as a whole
may become more vulnerable to further environmental stress
or disease. Sometimes a large number of individuals in a
population die as a result of overshooting the carrying
capacity of their habitat. This is known as a die-off.
Certain animals and plants have a built-in sense of
carrying capacity, so that instead of overshooting and having
a die-off, they remain within the limits of their habitat’s
ability to support them. Lake trout, for instance, stop
breeding as prolifically when the population density
increases too dramatically. Although this is the result of
individual responses to chemical signals from other trout
rather than a thought-out response on the part of the trout,
the result is that population numbers may
for extended periods. The trout will produce more offspring
and mature to a reproductive size at a faster rate when
populations are threatened, such as when aggressive fishing
takes place. When space and food are scarce, such as when a
lot of fish are living together in a small pond, the trout
remain smaller and reproduce more slowly. Experiments
have shown that no matter what number of lake trout a pond
is stocked with in the beginning, the population will increase
until it reaches a particular density, then level off at about the
same number.

(A)
In Australia a few years ago, I met a remarkable man
named John Walton. He has since become a close friend. He
told me that when he started out in life he seemed to be
caught in a peculiar failure pattern. Whatever he tried would
start out well and then end up badly. As a schoolboy he
dropped out of several schools for this reason. He became
convinced that it was his destiny in life to make good
beginnings and then watch them fade away.
(B)
The speaker also said, “Most of you are letting the fear of
failure hold you back. All the ingredients of success are right
there inside you, if you’ll just turn your thinking around.
Don’t keep telling yourself you can’t do this or you can’t do
that. You can do ANYTHING if you think you can!” John
had never heard anything like this in his whole life. He
realized for the first time that his image of himself as a
person who started well and then faded away was all in his
head, a state of mind that could be altered any time he made
a firm decision to alter it.
(C)
At one point, John got a job with the Australian division of a
famous American company. The same dreary pattern seemed
to be unfolding: He started out well, and then things began to
slide. This didn’t surprise him much; it was what he expected
to happen. Then the company sent a motivational speaker out
to give some talks to their Australian employees, and John
was in the audience. The visitor told his listeners to visualize
themselves moving up in the company, receiving promotions,
gaining energy as they went, right up to the very top.
(D)
John went back to work with tremendous enthusiasm and
confidence and energy. He received promotions. He became
the manager of a branch in New South Wales. Finally he
became the head of the company for all of Australia. Where
once he had been dogged by failure, now everything he did
was crowned by success. He told me, “It was that one talk
that changed my self-image by giving it a little twist. It made
me see myself differently, and so I was different.”

When people expect to see someone again, they are
more likely to find that person attractive, regardless of the
individual’s behavior, than if they do not have expectations
of future interaction. The expectation of future interaction
motivates people to look for positive qualities in someone
so that they will look forward to future interactions rather
than dread them, and increases the chances that people
will find the individual attractive. Conversely, when people
interact with someone whom they do not foresee meeting
again, they have little reason to search for positive
qualities. In fact, doing so may be depressing, given that
they may not have the opportunity to get to know the
person better in future interactions. Indeed, people are
sometimes motivated to find negative qualities in
individuals whom they do not expect to see again.

Even when scientists are able to identify seemingly
beneficial nutrients, they cannot always understand how
those nutrients will operate in a real-life context, in the
course of our daily meals. Fruits and vegetables are believed
to help prevent cancer. Scientists have believed that it is the
antioxidants in these foods that make the difference ―
compounds like beta carotene, lycopene, and vitamin E. Yet
when these molecules were extracted from fruits and
vegetables and made into supplements, they did not reduce
cancer. The beta carotene supplement actually increased the
risk of certain cancers. In other words, scientists thoroughly
misunderstood the causes of complex events. They identified
one element engaged in the process of nutrition without
fully comprehending how the system as a whole truly
functions. Nutritional scientists ― pursuing the hot paradigm
of isolating nutrients ― failed to see a multitude of links in
the complex chain that leads to good health.
* antioxidant: 산화 방지제
(1) problems of making nutritional supplements out of plants
(2) needs for an alternative scientific method for isolating
nutrients
(3) insufficient understanding of how nutrients work in the
whole system
(4) potential benefits of extracting molecules from fruits
and vegetables
(5) challenge of finding beneficial nutrients that may help
prevent cancers

Artists create artistic works to get viewers to have
certain kinds of experiences. But the intention to convey
certain experiences to viewers is sometimes secondary to
the intention to express the artistic imagination creatively.
Consider actions generally for the moment. Think, for
example, of people watching their favorite sporting team.
Whether it is at an actual match or in a bar, at crucial
periods in a game people tend to make gestures in
anticipation or cheer in exhortation. They often want to
convey their sense of urgency to the team, or people at
the bar may want to show their disgust to others in the
crowd. But they often express themselves in this manner
without any thought for what others think or how they
may respond. Actions we perform through which we
intend to express our feelings, thoughts, and attitudes
need not have any communicative intent for how others
may respond. At least some works should be understood
as the representation of just this kind of action.
* exhortation: 권고, 충고
(1) Artistic Act: To Express Rather than to Communicate
(2) Artistic Masterpieces: Products of Viewers’ Desires
(3) Artistic Works Beyond Artists’ Imagination
(4) Artworks Not for Artists but for Viewers

American archaeologist-ethnohistorian Zelia Maria Magdalena
Nuttall was well known especially for her investigations of
pre-Columbian culture and her studies of Mexican peoples
and native Mexican plants. Nuttall was a brilliant archival
researcher and self-trained archaeologist who very early carved
a career for herself by pursuing independent research and
publishing in scholarly journals. Before age 30 she became
a member of several highly prestigious scientific societies
on the basis of her work. She was the winner of three
medals for the exhibits of the results of her archival work
and archaeological research, which she presented in Europe
and the United States. Nuttall was never a part of university
teaching faculty, and indeed there is no indication that she
would have accepted such a position had it been offered.
Early in her career, she was appointed Honorary Assistant
in Mexican Archaeology at the Peabody Museum of
Harvard University, a post she held for forty-seven years.

environmentally friendly. It has been welcome as an
alternative material for a long time in building houses
instead of cement or bricks. However, it is not always
easy to of one particular
material such as wood over another. Many species of tree
are now endangered, including mahogany and teak, and
deforestation, particularly in tropical rainforests, has had a
severe impact both on local communities and on native
plants and wildlife. Where wood is harvested and then
transported halfway across the globe, the associated energy
costs are high, causing a negative impact on the
environment. What is more, where wood is treated with
chemicals to improve fire- and pest-resistance, its healthful
properties are compromised.

(2) favor the chemical properties
(3) dominate the natural habitats
(4) evaluate the relative merits
(5) deny the cost advantage
32. So often, we get caught up in the minutiae of our jobs
― tedious annoyances and struggles that may be temporary
roadblocks but feel more like concrete mountains. While
there’s plenty of research that shows that people who
work with the muscles above their neck create all kinds
of stresses for themselves, it’s the people who focus on
the why of their jobs (as opposed to the what and the
how) who can manage the day-to-day problems more
easily. That is, if you can define the purpose of your
career or feel passionate about the mission of your
company, you can much more easily handle the occasional
server maintenance that disrupts your in-box. The flip side
is that if you’re working in any area (or company) that
doesn’t align with your own value, all the little stuff

(5) illuminates the true value of what you have to do
33. People knowingly or unknowingly will take too much,
even though it is not for anyone’s collective or long-term
good. As Hardin put it, “Freedom in a commons brings
ruin to all.” Consider a traffic jam on a main road going
into any big city. Each person picks that particular road
for the logical reason that it’s the fastest route. In the
beginning, each additional car does not slow the traffic
down, as there is enough room on the road for the
additional drivers. At some point, however, each car
reduces the average speed, and eventually there are so
many drivers that the traffic slows to a crawl. All the
people seeking to minimize their own driving time add
up to a longer commute for everyone. Doing what’s

including you. On a global scale, the same thing can
befall environmental issues such as overfished seas and
rivers, air pollution, and water scarcity. [3점]
(1) leads to logical consequences for all drivers

34. Researchers asked college student volunteers to think
through a fantasy version of an experience (looking
attractive in a pair of high-heeled shoes, winning an essay
contest, or getting an A on a test) and then evaluated the
fantasy’s effect on the subjects and on how things
unfolded in reality. When participants envisioned the most
positive outcome, their energy levels, as measured by
blood pressure, dropped, and they reported having a worse
experience with the actual event than those who had
conjured more realistic or even negative visions. To assess
subjects’ real life experiences, the researchers compared
lists of goals that subjects had set for themselves against
what they had actually accomplished and also relied on
self-reports. “When we fantasize about it ― especially when
you fantasize something very positive ― it’s almost like
you are actually living it,” says one of the study’s
co-authors. That ,
draining the incentive to “get energized to go and get it,”
she explains. Subjects may be better off imagining how to
surmount obstacles instead of ignoring them. [3점]
(1) prompts you into assessing the real life as it is

(3) renders your goal independent of the fantasy world
(4) tricks the mind into thinking the goal has been achieved
(5) deceives your mind into believing obstacles are insurmountable

35. When confronted by a seemingly simple pointing task,
where their desires are put in conflict with outcomes,
chimpanzees find it impossible to exhibit subtle selfserving
cognitive strategies in the immediate presence of
a desired reward. However, such tasks are mastered
. In one
study, chimps were confronted by a simple choice; two
plates holding tasty food items were presented, each with
a different number of treats. If the chimp pointed to the
plate having more treats, it would immediately be given
to a fellow chimp in an adjacent cage, and the frustrated
subject would receive the smaller amount. After hundreds
and hundreds of trials, these chimps could not learn to
withhold pointing to the larger reward. However, these
same chimps had already been taught the symbolic concept
of simple numbers. When those numbers were placed on the
plates as a substitute for the actual rewards, the chimps
promptly learned to point to the smaller numbers first,
thereby obtaining the larger rewards for themselves. [3점]
(1) as immediate rewards replace delayed ones
(2) when an alternative symbol system is employed
(3) if their desires for the larger rewards are satisfied
(4) when material rewards alternate with symbolic ones
(5) if the value of the number is proportional to the amount
of the reward

36. After making a choice, the decision ultimately changes
our estimated pleasure, enhancing the expected pleasure
from the selected option and decreasing the expected
pleasure from the rejected option. If we were not inclined
to (A) the value of our options rapidly so that
they concur with our choices, we would likely second-guess
ourselves to the point of insanity. We would ask ourselves
again and again whether we should have chosen Greece
over Thailand, the toaster over the coffee maker, and Jenny
over Michele. Consistently second-guessing ourselves would
interfere with our daily functioning and promote a negative
effect. We would feel anxious and confused, regretful and
sad. Have we done the right thing? Should we change our
mind? These thoughts would result in a permanent halt.
We would find ourselves ― literally ― stuck, overcome by

on the number of correct answers on a page full of
computational problems. Learning and memorizing facts,
therefore, was the key component to the mathematics
instructional program. Recently, (A) , many teachers
have started placing a greater emphasis on mathematical
understanding, problem solving, hands-on experiences, and
collaborative work. This change in the instructional
program can be attributed to well-informed teachers and the
work of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics.
Now teachers should realize that their students will be
using mathematics in a world where calculators, computers,
and other forms of technology are readily available.
Therefore, the application of mathematics, rather than mere
fact acquisition, is what will be expected of them in the

The experimenter then changed the context so that the
participants had to do a subtly different task.
By changing the focus or context of a task, we can get
renewed energy even when we feel that we are completely
out of energy. To demonstrate this, a psychologist asked
people to take part in what she called ‘semi-free tasks’. The
tasks included drawing, repeatedly writing ‘ababababababab...’,
or reading a short poem. ( (1) ) The participants were
asked to do these tasks until they felt exhausted. ( (2) )
Those drawing were asked to redraw their last picture to
demonstrate how quickly they could draw. ( (3) ) Those
writing ‘abab’ were asked to sign their name and address.

During the 1970s, researchers began to suggest that
human vulnerability to hazards, rather than the hazards
themselves, was central to understanding the importance
of hazards, particularly when considering that a city is a
geographical focus for large populations. Further, it was
reported that human and material losses from disasters
had increased during the 20th century. This happened at
a time when cities in the developing world were
growing at unprecedented rates, bringing together large
populations of low income urban residents, often on
hazardous spontaneous settlements which made them far
more vulnerable to natural and human-induced hazards.
It is precisely this issue of vulnerability on which a
number of social scientists focused, arguing that although
floods, landslides and earthquakes are natural processes,
the disasters that can be associated with them are not a
result of natural processes, but of human vulnerability.

provides, you’ll end up with unrealistic expectations for
yourself, explains a psychologist. You could wind up in
a position where failure, which has gathered under cover
of darkness, reveals itself all at once.
We should hope, then, for exposure to failure, early
and often. The sociologist Glen Elder proposed that
there is a sensitive period for growth ― late teens
through early 30s ― during which failures are most
beneficial. Such a pattern seems to promote the trait
sometimes called equanimity. We learn that trauma is
survivable, so we don’t plunge too deeply following
setbacks. Nor, conversely, do we soar too high on our
successes. Some businesses in Silicon Valley and on
Wall Street make a point of hiring ex-pro athletes to
their staffs. It’s not just that their high profile draws
business. It’s because athletes are good at recovering
from their failures. “We needed people who could
perform and not get emotionally attached to losses,” a
Chicago oil trader told the New York Times, explaining
why the firm likes athletes on the trading floor,
particularly in ugly economic times like these. The
image is of a rider easy in the saddle. Nothing can so
surprise her ― either for good or ill ― that she’ll be
knocked off.
One way to help keep life’s slings and arrows from
knocking you off course is to ensure your life is
, says Stephen Berglas, a California
psychologist and personal coach. That way, a setback in
any one area won’t mean in your mind that you’re a
failure categorically. Call it spreading your risk across
your emotional portfolio ― or adding another leg to the
furniture for balance, says Berglas.

(A)
To be creative problem solvers, people must learn to
approach complexity with a certain naive simplicity. And
by letting their thinking become more free, they can
improve their chances of discovering new unencumbered
perceptions of old problems or entirely new creations.
For this, they can mentally play with the ideas in a
childlike manner. Here is an example story. In a small
Moravian village at the time of the old Austrian empire,
an inspector from the Ministry of Education arrived one
day to visit the schoolroom. It was part of (a) his duty
to make such periodic inspections of the schools.
* unencumbered: 방해받지 않는
(B)
At the end of the hour, after he had observed the
class, he stood up and said: “I am glad to see that you
children are doing well in your studies. I am satisfied
with your progress. Therefore, before I go, there is one
question I would like to ask. How many hairs does a
horse have?” Very quickly one little nine-year-old boy
raised his hand, to the astonishment of the teacher and
the visitor. (b) He stood up and said, “The horse has
3,571,962 hairs.” The inspector wonderingly asked, “And
how do you know that this is the right number?” The
boy replied, “If you do not believe me, you could count
them yourself.”
(C)
It was a year later, and the inspector was back again
at the village school for his annual visit. As the teacher
was walking along the aisle with (c) him to the door, he
stopped and said, “By the way, Mr. Inspector, how did
your colleagues like the story of the horse and the
number of his hairs?” The inspector slapped the teacher
on the back. “Oh yes,” he said, “you know, I was
really very anxious to tell that story ― and a fine story
it was ― but you see, I wasn’t able for the life of me
to remember the number of hairs.”
(D)
The inspector broke into loud laughter, thoroughly
enjoying the boy’s remark. As the teacher escorted (d) him
along the aisle to the door, still laughing heartily, he
said: “What an amusing story! I must tell this story to
my colleagues when I return to Vienna. I can already see
how they will take it; they enjoy nothing better than a
good joke.” And with that, he took (e) his leave.

In our efforts to be the good child, the uncomplaining
employee, or the cooperative patient, many of us fall into the
trap of trying to please people by going along with whatever
they want us to do. At times, we lose track of our own
boundaries and needs, and the cost of this could be our life,
both symbolically and literally. When we are unable to set
healthy limits, it causes distress in our relationships. But when
we learn to say no to what we don’t feel like doing in order to
say yes to our true self, we feel empowered, and our
relationships with others improve. So don’t be afraid to say
no. Try to catch yourself in the moment and use your true
voice to say what you really want to say.
(1) 난관을 극복할 때 성취감이 생긴다.
(2) 항상 타인의 입장을 먼저 고려해야 한다.

(5) 제안을 승낙하기 전에는 그 의도를 파악해야 한다.
24. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?
In order to successfully release himself from the control of
his parents, a child must be secure in his parents’ power, as
represented by their loving authority. The more effectively they
communicate that authority, the more secure the child feels, and
the better able he is to move away from them toward a life of his
own. During this lengthy process, whenever he feels threatened,
he turns back toward the safety of his parents’ love and
authority. In other words, it is impossible for a child to
successfully release himself unless he knows exactly where his
parents stand, both literally and figuratively. That requires, of
course, that his parents know where they themselves stand. If
they don’t know where they stand ― if, in other words, they are
insecure in their authority ― they cannot communicate security
to their child, and he cannot move successfully away from
them. Under the circumstances, he will become clingy, or
disobedient, or both.
(1) necessity of parental intervention in ensuring children’s
safety
(2) roles of parental authority in children’s social skills
development
(3) consequences of offering parental supervision for children’s
independence
(4) requirements for preventing children from being disobedient
to their parents
(5) importance of communicating parental authority to children
for their independence

The names of pitches are associated with particular
frequency values. Our current system is called A440 because
the note we call ‘A’ that is in the middle of the piano keyboard
has been fixed to have a frequency of 440 Hz. This is entirely
arbitrary. We could fix ‘A’ at any frequency, such as 439 or
424; different standards were used in the time of Mozart than
today. Some people claim that the precise frequencies affect
the overall sound of a musical piece and the sound of
instruments. Led Zeppelin, a band popular in the 70s, often
tuned their instruments away from the modern A440 standard
to give their music an uncommon sound, and perhaps to link it
with the European children’s folk songs that inspired many of
their compositions. Many purists insist on hearing baroque
music on period instruments, both because the instruments
have a different sound and because they are designed to play
the music in its original tuning standard, something that
purists deem important.

A friend of mine was sitting in the Miami airport reading a

attention was distracted by a rough, noisy quarrel taking place

heart was touched with compassion for (3) the distressed mother.
She walked over to the ticket agent and offered to take a later

Oxygen is what it is all about. Ironically, the stuff that gives

On the other hand, free radicals move (4) uncontrollably

When people started to plant stored seed stock deliberately,
they also began protecting their plants. This changed the
evolutionary (1) pressure that these food plants experienced, as
they no longer had to survive in a natural environment.
Instead, people created a new environment for them, and
selected for other characteristics than nature previously had.
Seeds recovered at archaeological sites clearly show that
farmers selected for larger seeds and (2) thinner seed coats.
Thick seed coats are often (3) essential for seeds to survive in
a natural environment because the seeds of many wild plants
remain dormant for months until winter is over and rain sets
in. But under human management thick seed coats are
unnecessary, as farmers (4) evade responsibility for storing
seeds away from moisture and predators. In fact, seeds with
thinner coats were (5) preferred as they are easier to eat or
process into flour, and they allow seedlings to sprout more

The graph above shows the Canadian volunteer rates and
average annual hours of seven age groups in 2007. (1) In these
groups, the volunteer rates ranged from 29% to 58%, and the
Canadian average rate was 46%. (2) The average annual hours
increased with age except for the group aged between 25 and
34, which volunteered an average of 133 hours. (3) The 15-24
age group showed the highest volunteer rate but the second
fewest average annual hours. (4) The 35-44 age group had
fewer average annual hours than the 45-54 age group, while
the 55-64 and 65-74 age groups showed the same average

seniors aged 75 and older gave more hours on average than
any other age group.
30. Fourier에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier was a French mathematician
and physicist. When he was eight years old, his father died, and
less than a year after this tragedy, his mother passed away,
leaving him an orphan. A charitable lady helped him attend a
local military school. He wanted to become an officer but was
not allowed to because he was the son of a tailor. In 1795, he
became a teacher at the École Normale in Paris. During the
post-Revolution frenzy, he spoke out against the use of the
guillotine, for which he almost lost his life. When Napoleon
invaded Egypt in 1798, Fourier and other scholars accompanied
the expedition. Having returned to France, Fourier began his
research on heat conduction. His mathematical theory of heat
conduction earned him lasting fame. During his stay in Egypt he
contracted a strange illness that confined him to well-heated
rooms for the rest of his life. On May 16, 1830, Fourier died in
Paris.

31. Sometimes all the outcomes customers are trying to achieve
in one area have a negative effect on other outcomes. This is
very common when companies are busy listening to the ‘voice
of the customer.’ Traveling salespeople, for example, may say
they want a smaller cell phone, but they may not have thought
about how hard that tiny phone will be to use. Carpenters may
request a lightweight circular saw without thinking about the
fact that it will no longer have the power to get through some of
the more difficult jobs. When customers make requests for new
product features, they are usually focused on solving just one
problem and are not thinking of how their requested solution
will .
In this situation, customers request new features but reject the
resulting product when they realize the ramifications of their
suggestions ― the added feature turns out to be worthless
because of the problems it causes.
* ramification: 파생된 문제
(1) impact other product or service functions
(2) delay the introduction of innovative products
(3) induce other customers to make additional requests
(4) bring about excessive competition among companies
(5) discourage companies from listening to customers’ voices
32. The success of human beings depends crucially on numbers
and connections. A few hundred people cannot sustain a
sophisticated technology. Recall that Australia was colonized
45,000 years ago by pioneers spreading east from Africa along
the shore of Asia. The vanguard of such a migration must have
been small in number and must have traveled comparatively
light. The chances are they had only a sample of the
technology available to their relatives back at the Red Sea
crossing. This may explain why Australian aboriginal
technology, although it developed and elaborated steadily over
the ensuing millennia, was lacking in so many features of the
Old World ― elastic weapons, for example, such as bows and
catapults, were unknown, as were ovens. It was not that they
were ‘primitive’ or that they had mentally regressed; it was
that they
and did not have a dense enough population and therefore a
large enough collective brain to develop them much further. [3점]
* catapult: 투석기
(1) were too tightly connected to develop new technologies
(2) focused on developing and elaborating elastic weapons
(3) had arrived with only a subset of technologies
(4) inherited none of their relatives’ technologies in Africa
(5) failed to transfer their technical insights to the Old World
33. Policymaking is seen to be more objective when experts
play a large role in the creation and implementation of the
policy, and when utilitarian rationality is the dominant value
that guides policy. Through the use of the scientific method to
determine the facts of any given policy situation, the power of
social constructions is supposedly diminished, and solutions to
social problems are discovered in an objective way. This
process creates an illusion of neutrality and implies a
transcendence of the pitfalls and inequalities commonly
associated with policymaking. From this perspective, scientists
and professionals emerge as the appropriate experts to be
consulted in policymaking, while local citizen input and
knowledge is often viewed as unnecessary. Scientific and
professional policy design does not necessarily escape the
pitfalls of degenerative politics. Scientific and professional
expertise often relies on a particular type of knowledge that is
limited to utility and rationality considerations. This approach
to policy typically does not consider values and cultural factors
that cannot be measured empirically. Scientifically designed
policies can serve interests that run counter to the public
interest. They . [3점]
* transcendence: 초월

34. Like many errors and biases that seem irrational on the
surface, auditory looming turns out, on closer examination, to
be pretty smart. Animals like rhesus monkeys have evolved
the same bias. This intentional error functions as an advance
warning system, manned by the self-protection subself,
providing individuals with a margin of safety when they are
confronted with potentially dangerous approaching objects.
If you spot a rhinoceros or hear an avalanche speeding
toward you, auditory looming will motivate you to jump
out of the way now rather than wait until the last second.
The evolutionary benefits of immediately getting out of the
way of approaching dangers were so strong that natural
selection endowed us ― and other mammals ― with brains
that . Although
this kind of bias might inhibit economically rational
judgment in laboratory tasks, it leads us to behave in a
deeply rational manner in the real world. Being accurate is not
always smart. [3점]
* avalanche: 눈사태
(1) intentionally see and hear the world inaccurately
(2) are geared to evaluate aural information precisely
(3) deliberately make rational yet ineffective decisions
(4) prompt us to overlook dangers without thinking rationally
(5) accurately detect, but irrationally ignore, approaching dangers

35. Mathematics will attract those it can attract, but it will do
nothing to overcome resistance to science. Science is universal
in principle but in practice it speaks to very few. Mathematics
may be considered a communication skill of the highest type,
frictionless so to speak; and at the opposite pole from
mathematics, the fruits of science show the practical benefits of
science without the use of words. But those fruits are
ambivalent. Science as science does not speak; ideally,
all scientific concepts are mathematized when scientists
communicate with one another, and when science displays its
products to non-scientists it need not, and indeed is not able to,
resort to salesmanship. When science speaks to others, it is no
longer science, and the scientist becomes or has to hire a
publicist who dilutes the exactness of mathematics. In doing
so, the scientist reverses his drive toward mathematical
exactness in favor of rhetorical vagueness and metaphor, thus

(1) degrading his ability to use the scientific language needed

and the public

It does this by overvaluing evidence that confirms what we

gas-producing areas, but increase the possibility of
exploration in areas of the Arctic through the reduction in ice
cover. Thus, while climate change may not impact these
resources, oil and gas reserves and known or potential
resources could be affected by new climate conditions, since
climate change may affect access to these resources. In
Siberia, (B) , the actual exploration challenge is the
time required to access, produce, and deliver oil under extreme
environmental conditions, where temperatures in January
range from —20℃ to —35℃. Warming may ease extreme
environmental conditions, expanding the production frontier.

We tend to perceive the door of a classroom as
rectangular no matter from which angle it is viewed.
Actually, the rectangular door of a classroom projects a
rectangular image on our retina only when it is viewed
directly from the front.
(A) Slowly the trapezoid becomes thinner and thinner, and all
that is projected on the retina is a vertical line, which is
the thickness of the door. These changes we can observe
and distinguish, but we do not accept them.
(B) Similarly, a round coin is seen as round even when
viewed from an angle at which, objectively, it should
appear elliptical. In the same way, we see car wheels as
round, even though the retinal image is oval when viewed
from an angle other than directly from the front.
(C) At other angles, the image will be seen as a trapezoid.
The edge of the door towards us looks wider than the
edge hinged with the frame.

So, when someone is threatening to go to war, or trying to
convince us and mounting a huge public relations campaign
to justify it, the news media have a responsibility to
question everything.
It’s important that the media provide us with diverse and
opposing views, so we can choose the best available options.
Let’s take the example of going to war. ( (1) ) War should be
a last resort, obviously, undertaken when all other options
have failed. ( (2) ) They should be providing the most intense
scrutiny on our behalf, so the public can see the other side of
things. ( (3) ) Otherwise, we may be drawn into unnecessary
wars, or wars fought for reasons other than those presented
by governments and generals. ( (4) ) Most of the time, the
media fail to perform this crucial role. ( (5) ) Even the large,
so-called ‘liberal’ American media have admitted that they
have not always been watchdogs for the public interest, and
that their own coverage on some major issues “looks
strikingly one-sided at times.”
* scrutiny: 면밀한 조사

Low-balling describes the technique where two
individuals arrive at an agreement and then one increases
the cost to be incurred by the other. For example, after the
consumer has agreed to purchase a car for $8,000, the
salesperson begins to add on $100 for tax and $200 for
tires. These additional costs might be thought of as a
metaphorical ‘low ball’ that the salesperson throws the
consumer. One explanation for the effectiveness of
low-balling is in terms of self-perception theory. When the
consumer agrees to purchase the product under the original
terms, that behavior might be used by the consumer to
infer his sincere interest in the product. This inferred
sincere interest in the product may enable him to endure
the increased cost. An alternative explanation is in terms
of impression management theory. If the consumer were
to withdraw from the deal after the ‘slight’ change in the
terms of agreement, he might foster the rather undesirable
impression of being an irresponsible consumer unaware of
these necessary charges.

There is a difference between getting what you want and
getting what you think you want. Technology gives us more
and more of what we think we want. These days, looking at
sociable robots and digitized friends, one might assume that
what we want is to be always in touch and never alone, no
matter who or what we are in touch with. One might assume
that what we want is plenty of weak ties, the informal
networks that underpin online acquaintanceship. But if we
pay attention to the real consequences of what we think we
want, we may discover what we really want. We may want
some stillness and solitude. As an American writer once put
it, we may want to live less ‘thickly’ and wait for more
infrequent but meaningful . As we
put in our many hours of typing ― with all fingers or just
thumbs ― we may discover that we miss the human voice.
We may decide that it is fine to play chess with a robot, but
that robots are unfit for any conversation about family or
friends. A robot might have needs, but to understand desire,
one needs language and flesh. We may decide that for these
conversations, we must have a person who knows, firsthand,
what it means to be born, to have parents and a family, to
wish for love and perhaps children, and to anticipate death.
And, of course, we must not let the virtual take us away from
the real world that doesn’t go away with a power outage.

(A)
How much space do you need to be happy? Part of the
American story is that bigger is better, and with cheap credit
and tax breaks for home buyers, it’s tempting to stretch one’s
finances to build or buy a larger house. My grandpa Otto
chose a different path. (a) He didn’t want to find himself
working longer and longer hours just to pay for more space
and the stuff to fill it. He grew up in a farming community
and within a very large family, so living simply was integral
to his life philosophy.
(B)
Yet my grandpa loved his little home and was content with
what he had. Even though the house was small, it didn’t feel
cramped. As my dad said, “Everyone was happy and content.
The size of the house didn’t matter.” My grandpa taught me
that living a simple life isn’t about self-deprivation. Instead,
it’s about giving yourself the time, freedom, and money to
pursue your dreams. In many ways, I’ve modeled my life after
that of my grandpa. I learned from (b) him that simplicity
isn’t about austerity. It’s a revolution in personal growth.
(C)
In the 1950s, when my dad was a little boy, my grandpa
built a 600-square-foot cottage. (c) He put the twenty-bythirty-
foot structure on a small plot of land in Pleasant Hill.
Dad remarked, “Reusing and recycling was a necessity. In
essence, (d) he was recycling before it became ‘cool.’”
Grandpa got most of the materials for his little house from
the Oakland docks, where he was working. It took four years
to build the small cottage, and when they moved in, the roof
wasn’t even on!
(D)
My dad recalled looking up at the stars in the roofless
house as a twelve-year-old kid before falling asleep. Dad
didn’t mind living in an unfinished house. (e) He described
Pleasant Hill as “open and private. It felt like all the homes
were on ten acres.” Over the years, my dad and grandpa
noticed dramatic changes in their community. Each year
more farmland was devoured to build strip malls and
neighborhoods with larger homes. As real estate prices rose,
many of their neighbors sold their homes and lots. Soon my
grandpa had the only small house on the block, surrounded
by a sea of homes four times the size of his dwelling.
