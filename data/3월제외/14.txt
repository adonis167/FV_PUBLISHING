Obviously, one of the judgments the public has of us is
whether or not our telephone service is good. Technically, if
they get their calls through, efficiently and promptly, they
get what they want. That, however, is not all they want.
They want to have the service rendered to them in a manner
that pleases them; they want not only efficiency but courtesy
and consideration; and they are in a position to get what
they want. They are in the driver’s seat; they are paying the
bills; and an understanding of that fact is a real and
fundamental basis of public relations. In order, therefore, for
a great company to satisfactorily serve the public, it must
have a philosophy and a method of doing business which
will allow and insure that its people serve the public
efficiently and in a pleasing manner.

On the path to excellence, some obstacles may initially
seem overwhelming. Every performer experiences this feeling,
even the greatest performers in the world. If you believe
that the obstacles are too great to overcome, you will prove
yourself right even when you are wrong. Most seemingly
impossible obstacles can be overcome by seeing possibilities,
focusing on what is within your control, taking the first
step, and then focusing on the next step and the next step
after that. If your commitment becomes weak, remember
your dream and why it is important to you, find simple
joys in your daily pursuits, rejoice in the little victories or
small steps forward, and embrace the process of ongoing
learning. With a positive perspective and persistence, you
will get through and find a way through all obstacles.

For many years now, mediated entertainment such as TV
and film has been able to stimulate our optical and auditory
senses with sights and sounds. Some forms of new media,
however, even engage our senses of touch and smell. The
view the wearer of some special device sees is projected on
the screen behind him. Wearers become immersed in the
computerized scene and use the gloves to pick up and
move simulated objects. Many virtual reality games and
rides now allow audiences and players to feel sensations of
motion and touch. New media may also include aromas,
such as Disney’s “Soaring Over California” attraction at the
California Adventure theme park, where audiences smell
orange orchards and pine forests while enjoying a simulated
hang-gliding experience across the countryside. Makers of
emerging forms of entertainment will likely continue to
experiment with ways they can simulate and manipulate
reality by stimulating our senses.

Recently, researchers have suggested that the purpose of
laughter is not just to communicate that one is in a playful
state, but to actually induce this state in others as well.
According to this view, the peculiar sounds of laughter have
a direct effect on the listener, inducing positive emotional
arousal that mirrors the emotional state of the laugher,
perhaps by activating certain specialized brain circuits. In this
way, laughter may serve an important biosocial function of
coupling together the positive emotions of members of a
group and thereby coordinating their activities. This would
explain why laughter is so infectious; when we hear someone
laughing, it is almost impossible not to feel cheerful and
begin laughing too.
(1) effects of laughter on others
(2) benefits of activating brain circuits
(3) strategies for coordinating activities
(4) negative aspects of emotional reactions
(5) importance of grouping in communication

During her childhood years, the artist Tammy Rahr spent
a lot of time outdoors making things from flowers and dirt.
Then Tammy and her family moved from the woodlands of
New York State to an urban city outside of Los Angeles,
California. The experience made her more aware of what was
going on in the world. After returning to New York State
with her family, Tammy faced another lesson in growing up.
A gifted student, she was sent to college when she was just
14. Tammy was able to earn her high school diploma and
some college credit before trying her hand at a number of
different jobs. Eventually, she moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico,
and studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts. After
graduating from the institute, she remained active with it and
the museum there.

In the twentieth century, advances in technology, from
refrigeration to sophisticated ovens to air transportation
(1) that carries fresh ingredients around the world, contributed
immeasurably to baking and pastry making. At the beginning
of the twenty-first century, the popularity of fine breads and
pastries (2) are growing even faster than new chefs can be
trained. Interestingly enough, many of the technological advances
in bread making have sparked a reaction among bakers and
consumers (3) alike. They are looking to reclaim some of the
flavors of old-fashioned breads that (4) were lost as baking
became more industrialized and baked goods became more
refined, standardized, and ― some would say ― flavorless.
Bakers are researching methods for (5) producing the handmade
sourdough breads of the past, and they are experimenting
with specialty flours in their search for flavor.

Although children watch television at various times, the
programming that they view alone tends to be specifically
aimed at children. In the United States particularly, most of
the advertising during this segment consists of ads for food,
particularly sugared food. During the run-up to Christmas,
(A) increasing / decreasing numbers of ads concern toys and
games. Such practices are believed to put pressure on parents
to yield to what the media have dubbed “pester power.”
This has led to calls for legislation to (B) promote / regulate

Dave Butcher, director of training for Sea World in

the sea lions could have all the fish (2) they wanted. One result
was that (3) they were not irritable, as any hungry animal
might be. The sea lions were friendly to those humans they

trainers on their lunch hour sunbathing in a pile with their

30. The true champion recognizes that excellence often flows
most smoothly from , a fact that can get lost in
these high-tech days. I used to train with a world-class
runner who was constantly hooking himself up to pulse
meters and pace keepers. He spent hours collecting data that
he thought would help him improve. In fact, a good 25
percent of his athletic time was devoted to externals other
than working out. Sports became so complex for him that he
forgot how to enjoy himself. Contrast his approach with that
of the late Abebe Bikila, the Ethiopian who won the 1960
Olympic Marathon running barefoot. High-tech clothing and
digital watches were not part of his world. Abebe Bikila
simply ran. Many times in running, and in other areas of
life, less is more. [3점]

31. The origins of contemporary Western thought can be
traced back to the golden age of ancient Greece, when Greek
thinkers laid the foundations for modern Western politics,
philosophy, science, and law. Their novel approach was to
pursue rational inquiry through adversarial discussion: The
best way to evaluate one set of ideas, they decided, was
by . In the
political sphere, the result was democracy, in which
supporters of rival policies vied for rhetorical supremacy; in
philosophy, it led to reasoned arguments and dialogues about
the nature of the world; in science, it prompted the
construction of competing theories to try to explain natural
phenomena; in the field of law, the result was the adversarial
legal system. This approach is the foundation for the modern
Western way of life, in which politics, commerce, science, and
law are all rooted in orderly competition. [3점]

32. I would like to compare the shift from analog to
digital film-making to the shift from fresco and tempera
to oil painting in the early Renaissance. A painter making
a fresco has limited time before the paint dries, and once
it has dried, no further changes to the image are possible.
Similarly, a traditional filmmaker has limited means of
modifying images once they are recorded on film.
Medieval tempera painting can be compared to the
practice of special effects during the analog period of
cinema. A painter working with tempera could modify
and rework the image, but the process was painstaking
and slow. The switch to oils greatly liberated painters by
allowing them to quickly create much larger compositions
as well as to modify them as long as necessary. Similarly,
,
digital technology redefines what can be done with
cinema. [3점]
(1) by equating oil painting with analog film-making
(2) by allowing a filmmaker to treat a film image as an
oil painting
(3) with the shift from oil painting styles to fresco ones
in making films
(4) by integrating fresco painting techniques into the
film-making process
(5) with the introduction of tempera painting methods to
cinematic special effects

When there is a discrepancy between the verbal message
and the nonverbal message, the latter typically weighs more
in forming a judgment. (A) , a friend might react
to a plan for dinner with a comment like “that’s good,” but
with little vocal enthusiasm and a muted facial expression.
In spite of the verbal comment, the lack of expressive
enthusiasm suggests that the plan isn’t viewed very
positively. In such a case, the purpose of the positive
comment might be to avoid a disagreement and support the
friend, but the lack of a positive expression unintentionally
leaks a more candid, negative reaction to the plan. Of
course, the muted expressive display might also be strategic
and intentional. (B) , the nonverbal message is
deliberate, but designed to let the partner know one’s candid
reaction indirectly. It is then the partner’s responsibility to
interpret the nonverbal message and make some adjustment
in the plan.

(1) In addition …… Instead
(2) In addition …… However

Early one night in 1973 in my old and cheap apartment
in Bangor, Maine, I got a phone call from my agent, Bill,
who was helping me publish my first novel. “Are you
sitting down?” Bill asked. “No,” I said. “Do I need to?”
“You might,” he said. “The publication rights for your
book were sold for four hundred thousand dollars!” I was
completely speechless. That amount of money was beyond
my wildest expectations. I was sure I hadn’t heard him
right. I couldn’t have. I asked, “Did you say it went for
forty thousand dollars?” Bill said it again as clearly as he
could, “Four hundred thousand dollars. Congratulations,
Steve.” “Are you sure, Bill?” I said in disbelief. He said he
was. We talked for another half an hour, but I don’t

35. Music can convey the scope of a film, effectively
communicating whether the motion picture is an epic drama
or a story that exists on a more personal scale. Music can
convey the quality and size of a space. (1) For example, in
Alien and Olivier’s Hamlet, the music serves at times to make
small and/or artificial spaces seem more grand and to
enhance the sense of realism. (2) In addition, music can
establish a narrative’s placement in time. (3) Music for motion
pictures often serves to authenticate the era or to provide a
sense of nostalgia. (4) Music has traditionally been classified
by musical instruments. (5) Examples of the former would
include Amadeus and Immortal Beloved, while a sense of
nostalgia is communicated through the music selected for
films such as American Graffiti and The Big Chill.
36. It is difficult to appreciate what a temperature of
20,000,000℃ means. (1) If the solar surface, not the center,
were as hot as this, the radiation emitted into space would
be so great that the whole Earth would be vaporized within
a few minutes. (2) Indeed, this is just what would happen if
some cosmic giant were to peel off the outer layers of the
Sun like skinning an orange, for the tremendously hot inner
regions would then be exposed. (3) It is believed that the
brightness of the Sun can be predicted theoretically.
(4) Fortunately, no such circumstance is possible, and the
outer layers of the Sun provide a sort of blanket that protects
us from its inner fires. (5) Yet in spite of these blanketing
layers, some energy must leak through from the Sun’s center
to its outer regions, and this leakage is of just the right
amount to compensate for the radiation emitted by the
surface into surrounding space.

Since group performance in problem solving is superior to

it should not be surprising that students learn better when
they cooperate. However, there is one issue that needs further

(B) Not quite. Knowledge, happily, is not a zero-sum product.
Higher-ability students can reinforce their own knowledge

But no one, even your child, is exactly like you.
Parents often believe that they are providing help to their
children when they constantly correct and criticize them,
assuming that they will grow from these remarks. But ask
yourself: Do you like being corrected? Do you grow when
you are constantly criticized? ( (1) ) In truth, we tend to
stay the same when we are criticized. ( (2) ) We want to
defend what we have done, and our innate stubbornness
refuses to permit us to accept the criticism we are receiving.

taking risks. ( (5) ) Create an environment in which your

An ant turns right, left, and moves ahead over a sandy
hill. How can we explain the complexity of the path it
chose? We can think up a sophisticated program in the
ant’s brain, but it does not work. What we have
overlooked is the ant’s environment. The ant may be
following a simple rule: get out of the sun and back to the
nest. Complex behavior does not imply complex mental
strategies. The same holds for humans. The apparent
complexity of a man’s behavior over time is largely a
reflection of the complexity of the environment in which
he finds himself. People adapt to their environments much
as gelatin does; if you wish to know what form it will
have when it solidifies, study the shape of the mold that
holds the gelatin. To understand behavior, one has to look
at both the mind and the environment.

the question. It is usually a win-win. The problem with
this is that the direct approach can have an unintended
consequence: the loss of confidence. Although the
question wanted for an explanation, what the asker
received was a statement of fact. Why does oil float on
top of water in a glass? Relative density. What causes
climate change? Increased CO2 in the atmosphere. Why
does the ocean have tides? The moon. Giving direct,
accurate, and factual answers may seem to solve the
problem from the perspective of the answerer. But in
reality, it can shut the asker down. A statement of fact
with no other context puts the burden on the asker to take
the next step. If the asker isn’t familiar with relative
density or CO2, he or she is likely to move on rather than
ask a follow-up question or probe for related ideas. Any
hope of becoming a customer of that idea is lost. This is
a failure in the form of a lost opportunity. Although direct
answers are often needed and well-placed, they do not
work universally. A skilled explainer learns to see the
intent behind the question and formulate an answer that
focuses on understanding instead of .

[43～45] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
It was my last football game as a college player. I made
the final tackle and we won. As people chanted my
name, (a) I was carried off the field on the shoulders of
my teammates. Although I wasn’t a great student or a
great football player, I ended up not only graduating from
my dream university but becoming a hero of the team.
People keep asking me how I did it. Here is my story.
(B)
It was so hard to break out of the box, but (b) I began
to feel an urgent need for a change. I signed up for the
Army and went to the Vietnam War. A lot of people were
worried, but I said, “Well, I’m going to get out of my box
by deciding what to do myself instead of having someone
else tell (c) me what to do.” With that one crucial shift in
thinking, my whole attitude changed. I began to dream of
going to one of the best universities in the country and
playing football.
(C)
I was born into a large poor family in Chicago. As a kid,
I had visions of being a hero ― a police officer or an
astronaut. However, people would always tell me, “You
can’t do that. You aren’t smart enough. You aren’t strong
enough.” Moreover, (d) I didn’t do well in school, and I had
no hope of getting into any college. After high school, I
gave up on my dream of going to college and got a
part-time job instead. I felt like I was living in a box labeled
“This is where you belong.”
(D)
After I finished my time in the Army, I packed my bags
and went to my dream university. I knocked on the door
of one of the professors’ offices and said, “Please, tell me
how to get in here.” The professor could see that I was
determined. He said, “I can’t let you in the university, but
(e) I will see you whenever you need my advice or help.”
It took me a long time, but I eventually got into that
university, became a football player, and graduated.

Everybody has moments of doubt about something or
other from time to time; it is a natural process. The
challenge is not to let those moments accumulate and
affect your self-belief. You will always face the challenge
of other people’s comments and opinion. There are
people that you feel good being around and others you
don’t. Some people give you positive energy because
they believe in you. You feel it and you rise to the
occasion. Others may always have a negative comment to
make about what you are doing or talking about. Don’t
let these comments rock your self-belief. Always question
the person’s reason for the comment. If it is based on
fact, you should listen; if not, then it is only their
opinion. You will need to stay strong.
* rise to the occasion: 위기 상황에서 능력을 발휘하다
(1) 인맥이 넓은 사람들과 교제하라.
(2) 성공하기 위해 도전적인 자세를 가지라.

Delia stepped out of the front door of her house, and the
day welcomed her with a warm and sunny smile. With each
step, she thought, “I can’t wait for today’s class.” Her
family had recently moved into the neighborhood, and the
new school year had just begun at Elanova High School.
Her new school offered ballet lessons, and Delia eagerly
signed up. She was one step closer to fulfilling her lifelong
dream of becoming a ballerina. Delia sat at the bench
waiting for the school bus. As the bus rolled down Madison
Avenue, she slipped her hand into her ballet bag to touch
her new shoes. She thought about working hard on her leaps
and jumps. “I want to soar to the moon,” Delia thought.

21. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?
One reason many people keep delaying things they should
do is that they fear they will do them wrong or poorly, so
they just don’t do them at all. For example, one of the best
ways to write a book is to write it as quickly as possible,
getting your thoughts onto paper without regard to style.
Then, you can go back to revise and polish your writing.
If I only wrote when I knew it would be perfect, I’d still
be working on my first book! Do you have a hard time
relaxing if your house is a mess? Do you beat yourself up
for making mistakes? I’ve got a simple message for you
today: It’s time to let go of your perfectionism. It becomes
a stumbling block that keeps you stuck.
(1) 잦은 실수는 큰 실수를 유발한다.
(2) 주변을 정리하는 습관이 중요하다.
(3) 책을 집필하기 위해서는 인내가 필요하다.

(5) 타인의 입장에서 생각하는 것이 바람직하다.

Textiles and clothing have functions that go beyond just
protecting the body. Dress and textiles alike are used as a
means of nonverbal communication. Obvious examples
would be the use of uniforms to communicate a particular
social role and the modern white wedding dress Western
cultures use to mark this rite of passage. Both types of
clothing communicate important information nonverbally to
the onlooker. The female wearing the white dress is about to
be married and change her status and role in society. The
person in the uniform has some specialized function in
society, such as police officer, nurse, or soldier. Therefore, it
can be said that clothing visually communicates information
about group membership and functions as an identity marker.
(1) educational functions of uniforms
(2) ways to diversify styles of clothing
(3) gender differences in choosing clothing
(4) different cultural norms of Western society
(5) nonverbal communicative functions of clothing
23. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Traditional consumption was not particularly thrifty. The
concept of thrift emerged out of a more affluent money
culture. In traditional societies where resources continued to
be scarce, consumption was more seasonally and
communally orientated. In years of bountiful crops people
ate heartily, and in lean years they starved. People were not
particularly motivated to produce more goods for
stockpiling, as there was little incentive to do so where
there was little security from raids. When times were good,
celebrations of gluttony were held in the winter season
when stocks could not be refilled. These rituals were more
important than the potential hardships such celebrations
might later bring, as they served to bind people together and
distribute resources. Holiday rituals were typically structured
around cultural practices such as song, dance, theater, and
feasting, and took a great deal of time away from work.

Living rock cactus is one of the most peculiar plants
found in the desert. For most of the year, it blends into
the rocky limestone soils of the Dead Horse Mountains,
Mariscal Mountain, and the hills along the Rio Grande.
You may step on one before you notice it. Spineless and
flat against the ground, it has triangular tubercles that
overlap in a star-shaped pattern. In extremely dry conditions,
living rock cactus is almost invisible: it literally shrinks
into the surrounding rocky soil. Moisture is stored in the
root, and during droughts the root shrinks, dragging the
stem underground. These spineless plants survive by
blending into their native habitat. As added protection,
they store foul-tasting, poisonous alkaloids in their bodies.

The term objectivity is important in measurement because
of the scientific demand that observations be subject to
public verification. A measurement system is objective to
the extent that two observers (A) evaluate / evaluating the
same performance arrive at the same (or very similar)
measurements. For example, using a tape measure to
determine the distance a javelin (B) threw / was thrown yields
very similar results regardless of who reads the tape. By
comparison, evaluation of performances such as diving,
gymnastics, and figure skating is more subjective ─ although
elaborate scoring rules help make (C) it / them more objective.
From the point of view of research in motor behavior, it is
important to use performances in the laboratory for which
the scoring can be as objective as possible.

A special feature of the real estate rental market is its
tendency to undergo a severe and prolonged contraction
phase, more so than with manufactured products. When the
supply of a manufactured product (1) exceeds the demand,
the manufacturer cuts back on output, and the merchant
reduces inventory to balance supply and demand.
However, (2) property owners cannot reduce the amount
of space available for rent in their buildings. Space that
was constructed to accommodate business and consumer
needs at the peak of the cycle (3) remains, so vacancy
rates climb and the downward trend becomes more severe.
Rental rates generally do not drop below a certain point,
the (4) maximum that must be charged in order to cover
operating expenses. Some owners will take space off the
market rather than lose money on it. A few, unable to
subsidize the property, will sell at distress prices, and
lenders will repossess others. These may then be placed
on the market at lower rental rates, further (5) depressing
the market.

Born in Budapest to a family of bankers, von Neumann
was undeniably bright. At age eight, (1) he had mastered
calculus. At age twelve, he was reading works aimed at
professional mathematicians. But (2) he also loved to
invent mechanical toys and became a child expert on
Byzantine history. When it was time to go off to
university, he agreed to study chemical engineering as a
compromise with his father, who feared that (3) his son
couldn’t make a living as a mathematician. Von Neumann
kept his bargain by enrolling at the University of
Budapest and promptly leaving for Berlin, where he spent
his time doing mathematics, and returning to Budapest at
the end of every semester to take examinations. He
published (4) his second mathematics paper, in which he
gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers, at age
nineteen. By age twenty-five (5) he had published ten
major papers; by age thirty, nearly three dozen.

application. If you believe you have something, but
you’re not sure what exactly it’s going to be good for,
don’t give up. Many innovations languished in labs for
years until they were . Teflon, an
extremely slippery synthetic substance employed as a
coating on cooking utensils, was invented in 1938, but it
didn’t coat its first pan till 1954. The Post-it note was
built on the back of some not-very-good glue. Its
inventor believed it might have value, but it took him
five years to find a potentially profitable use for it. HP
had a breakthrough with a super-accurate thermometer
that was created in the HP Labs. Despite its accuracy,
there was no clear use for the device until it was used to
measure fluctuations in ocean temperature. [3점]

32. Empathy is a character trait that we value in ourselves
and in our friends, colleagues, and the professionals who
serve us. The know-how to be empathetic is central to
practical wisdom: unless we can understand how others
think and feel, it’s difficult to know the right thing to do.
But empathy has its dark side: too much understanding and
sensitivity, too much seeing things from the other’s
perspective, can .
Edmund Pellegrino, a scholar of bioethics, explains it like
this: “If a physician identifies too closely as co-sufferer
with the patient, she loses the objectivity essential to the
most precise assessment of what is wrong, of what can be
done, and of what should be done to meet those needs.
Excessive co-suffering also impedes and may even
paralyze the physician into a state of inaction.”
* impede: 방해하다
(1) block everlasting friendship
(2) justify doctors’ abuse of power
(3) cloud judgment and paralyze choice
(4) lead to a hasty but correct diagnosis
(5) decrease doctors’ compassion for patients

33. Bees have their choice of flora according to color.
Lord Avenbury once made an experiment to see if the
color of flowers attracted bees. Placing honey on slips of
paper of different shades, he found that the insects which
visited them seemed to have a marked preference for
blue, after which came white, yellow, red, green and
orange. This finding should be considered for our
beekeeping planning. If pollination is the prime
consideration of taming bees and if the crop is identified,
while planning.
Let us consider beekeeping near a mustard field. Mustard
gives tiny yellow flowers full of nectar and pollen. For
better yield of mustard seeds, pollination is necessary.
But if there is plenty of blue-colored wild flora nearby,
bees may prefer the blue flowers to mustard. Although
we shall get honey and other products, the objective for
pollination of mustard may be defeated. [3점]
* flora: 식물군
(1) bees’ preference for color should be put aside
(2) a greater harvest can be expected near blue flora
(3) the quality of honey should be taken into account
(4) the abundance of blue flora nearby must be ensured
(5) the color of other floras nearby should be considered
34. In the mid-1900s, John Kenneth Galbraith shocked the
field of economics when he insisted that consumers do
not merely participate in the marketplace, they are also
the product of the systematic deployment of power
throughout society. Within this deployment of power,
commercial media ensures that consumers adopt values
and beliefs that match the general requirements of the
economy. The individual’s participation in mass behavior
patterns is .
Consumers engage in shared patterns of consumption
because they live within an economic system that
operates as a belief system. It exercises considerable
control over the meaning and value of things. When the
economy functions as a belief system, it establishes
severe limits on a consumer’s free choice. As consumers,
our choices are not entirely our own. Our beliefs, values,
thoughts, and emotions are highly conditioned to match
the needs of the marketplace. [3점]
* deployment: 배치
(1) not driven by commercial media’s agenda
(2) a product of unconditioned personal choice
(3) not a spontaneous reaction to random forces
(4) not affected by the needs of the marketplace
(5) an outcome irrelevant to the economic system

We’ve all heard the phrase “the family that plays
together, stays together.” The wisdom in this phrase is
that social play builds ties between people that are
lasting and consequential.
(A) In crying out, the danger-spotting squirrel draws
attention to itself, which may well attract the
predator. Scientists used to think that animals would
risk their lives like this only for kin with whom they
shared common genes.
(B) This wisdom holds outside the human family circle
as well. For example, when one ground squirrel sees
a predator in the distance, it will sound an alarm call
that alerts other squirrels to run for cover. It’s a
risky move.
(C) New evidence suggests, however, that squirrels also
sound alarm calls for former playmates, not genetically
related. These squirrels developed a social resource
while playing ― and these buddies will put their lives
on the line to save their playmates.

The study also revealed the commanders had given
more attention and praise to the crew members for
whom they had the higher expectations.
Self-fulfilling prophecies can have a positive side. ( (1) )
We know that students introduced to their teachers as
“intellectual bloomers” often do better on achievement
tests than do their counterparts who lack such a positive
introduction. ( (2) ) In a study of army tank crews, one
set of tank commanders was told that some members of
their assigned crews had exceptional abilities while others
were only average. ( (3) ) In reality, the crew members
had been assigned randomly so that the two test groups
were equal in ability. ( (4) ) The commanders later
reported that the so-called “exceptional” crew members
performed better than the “average” ones. ( (5) ) The
self-fulfilling effects in these cases strongly suggest that
managers adopt positive and optimistic approaches toward
others at work.

But neither are aware of this fact when it comes to
unmarked crosswalks.
Studies do show that motorists are more likely to yield
to pedestrians in marked crosswalks than at unmarked
crosswalks. But as some researchers found, that does not
necessarily make things safer. ( (1) ) When they compared
the way pedestrians crossed at both kinds of crosswalks
on roads with considerable traffic volumes, they found that
people at unmarked crosswalks tended to look both ways
more often, waited more often for gaps in traffic, and
crossed the road more quickly. ( (2) ) Researchers suspect
that both drivers and pedestrians are more aware that
drivers should yield to pedestrians in marked crosswalks.
( (3) ) Not knowing traffic safety laws, it turns out, is
actually a good thing for pedestrians. ( (4) ) Because they
do not know whether cars are supposed to stop, they act
more cautiously. ( (5) ) Marked crosswalks, by contrast,
may give pedestrians an unrealistic picture of their own
safety. [3점]

38. Some researchers investigated the effects of different
media on children’s ability to produce imaginative responses.
In one study, children in grades one through four were
separated randomly into two groups and presented with
the same fictional story. One group listened to the story
via radio, while the other group watched the story on a
television. (1) Afterward, all of the children were asked
what they thought would happen next in the story. (2) The
researchers rated children’s imaginativeness by recording
the novel elements (such as characters, setting, dialogue,
and feelings) they used in their responses. (3) Some
novelists prefer to include as many characters as possible
in their stories. (4) The children who listened to the radio
produced more imaginative responses, whereas the children
who watched the television produced more words that
repeated the original story. (5) Media scholars have used
this study to illustrate the “visualization hypothesis,” which
states that children’s exposure to ready-made visual images
restricts their ability to generate novel images of their own.
39. One of the many strengths of the African American
community is an intrinsic support for the athletic endeavors
of African American girls and women. (1) Since African
American culture appreciates a greater flexibility of gender
roles and accepts a broader range of gender-appropriate
behaviors, African American women are not as bound as
white women by gender role stereotypes. (2) Athletics for
girls and women is not perceived as conflicting with an African
American female’s gender role. (3) Hall and Bower’s study
of African American females found that African American
women defined themselves as “softly strong” ― owning
both strength and femininity without conflict. (4) African
American males have played an increasingly important role
in global politics. (5)Welcome support from the African
American community has energized many African American
girls and women to participate in sports.

Experts have found that reading classical texts benefits
the mind by catching the reader’s attention and triggering
moments of self-reflection. The brain activity of volunteers
was monitored as they read classical works. These same
texts were then “translated” into more straightforward,
modern language and again the readers’ brains were
monitored as they read the words. Scans showed that the
more challenging prose and poetry set off far more
electrical activity in the brain than the more pedestrian
versions. Scientists were able to study the brain activity as
it responded to each word and record how it lit up as the
readers encountered unusual words, surprising phrases or
difficult sentence structures. This lighting up lasts long
enough to shift the brain into a higher gear, encouraging
further reading. The research also found that reading the
more challenging version of poetry, in particular, increases
activity in the right hemisphere of the brain, helping the
readers to reflect on and reevaluate their own experiences
in light of what they have read. The academics said this
meant the classics were more useful than self-help books.
󰀻
Original versions of classical texts are helpful to readers
because they contain (A) language that inspires
further reading and (B) readers’ self-reflection.

(1) challenging …… distorts

Organisms must compete for resources not only with
members of their own species, but with members of
other species. When two species use the same resource
and the resource is scarce, the species must compete just
as if they were members of the same population. One
of the two species usually turns out to be better at the
competition. If two species eat exactly the same food, for
example, one of the two will be better at catching it.
Unless something interferes, the inferior competitor loses
out and the competitively superior species takes over.
When one species eliminates another by outcompeting it,
it is called competitive exclusion.
Sometimes a competitively superior species is prevented
from excluding poorer competitors. Periodic disturbances
such as severe storms, battering by drifting logs, or
underwater landslides can reduce the population of a
dominant competitor and give other species a chance.
Furthermore, which species is competitively superior
sometimes depends on the conditions. On rocky shores
in tropical Hong Kong, for example, foliose (leaf-like)
algae are the dominant seaweeds during the relatively
cool winter. In the summer heat, these forms die out
and are replaced by more resistant encrusting algae.
Seasonal variation thus prevents either group from
excluding the other, and there is a
between the competing species.

(A)
Jim Nelson, a junior at Manti High School, was an
outstanding athlete. He had just made the school
basketball team, one of the best in the state. But on
October 23, 1996, most of (a) his athletic future was
suddenly taken away from him. Jim was riding his
bicycle at night to visit his friend. The road was very
steep in some places. It was very dark and difficult to see.
(B)
Because of his injury, Jim wasn’t able to play on the
basketball team during the rest of that year, but the
coach did make him equipment manager so that he
could come and practice. All summer long in 1997, each
and every night, (b) he practiced making left-handed
baskets. When the next season arrived, Jim was ready to
try out for the team ― and he made it again!
(C)
As he came around a sloping curve on his bicycle, Jim
hit a car parked on the side of the road. (c) He ended
up in the hospital. Besides bad cuts on his head, he
broke his right arm and was in a cast for two months.
Jim’s doctor gave him a series of tests. The doctor
concluded that (d) he had suffered nerve damage and
that he might never regain the full use of his right arm.
(D)
Jim never became a starter, but he was always the
first substitute to go in the game. Jim got a chance to
play in the last 30 seconds of the championship game
when a starting player sprained (e) his ankle. With 10
seconds left, Jim balanced the ball in his left hand and
took the shot. The crowd was deathly quiet until ―
swish! He made the three-point-shot left-handed! Jim
won not only the game but also the hearts of his
teammates for proving that with determination, no
obstacle is too great.

One difference between winners and losers is how they handle
losing. Even for the best companies and most accomplished
professionals, long track records of success are punctuated by
slips, slides, and mini-turnarounds. Even the team that wins
the game might make mistakes and lag behind for part of it.
That’s why the ability to recover quickly is so important.
Troubles are ubiquitous. Surprises can fall from the sky like
volcanic ash and appear to change everything. That’s why one
prominent scholar said, “Anything can look like a failure in
the middle.” Thus, a key factor in high achievement is
bouncing back from the low points.

20. Many disciplines are better learned by entering into the
doing than by mere abstract study. This is often the case with
the most abstract as well as the seemingly more practical
disciplines. For example, within the philosophical disciplines,
logic must be learned through the use of examples and actual
problem solving. Only after some time and struggle does the
student begin to develop the insights and intuitions that enable
him to see the centrality and relevance of this mode of
thinking. This learning by doing is essential in many of the
sciences. For instance, only after a good deal of observation do
the sparks in the bubble chamber become recognizable as the
specific movements of identifiable particles.

(2) limitations of learning strategies
(3) importance of learning by doing
(4) effects of intuition on scientific discoveries

21. The most normal and competent child encounters what
seem like insurmountable problems in living. But by playing
them out, he may become able to cope with them in a
step-by-step process. He often does so in symbolic ways that
are hard for even him to understand, as he is reacting to inner
processes whose origin may be buried deep in his
unconscious. This may result in play that makes little sense to
us at the moment, since we do not know the purposes it
serves. When there is no immediate danger, it is usually best
to approve of the child’s play without interfering. Efforts to
assist him in his struggles, while well intentioned, may divert
him from seeking and eventually finding the solution that will
serve him best.
(1) dangers of playing violent games to mental health
(2) beneficial influence of playing outdoors in childhood
(3) children’s play as problem solving with minimal intervention
(4) necessity of intervening in disputes between siblings
(5) parental roles in children’s physical development

22. At some time in their lives, most people pause to reflect on
their own moral principles and on the practical implications of
those principles, and they sometimes think about what
principles people should have or which moral standards can
be best justified. When a person accepts a moral principle,
naturally the person believes the principle is important and
well justified. But there is more to moral principles than that.
When a principle is part of a person’s moral code, that person
is strongly motivated toward the conduct required by the
principle, and against behavior that conflicts with that
principle. The person will tend to feel guilty when his or her
own conduct violates that principle and to disapprove of
others whose behavior conflicts with it. Likewise, the person
will tend to hold in esteem those whose conduct shows an
abundance of the motivation required by the principle.

(2) Do Not Let Your Moral Principles Change!
(3) Moral Integrity: A Principle of Philosophy
(4) How Do People Form Their Personalities?

23. The key to successful risk taking is to understand that the
actions you’re taking should be the natural next step. One of
the mistakes we often make when confronting a risk situation
is our tendency to focus on the end result. Skiers who are
unsure of themselves often do this. They’ll go to the edge of a
difficult slope, look all the way down to the bottom, and
determine that the slope is too steep for them to try. The ones
that decide to make it change their focus by analyzing what
they need to do to master the first step, like getting through
the first mogul on the hill. Once they get there, they
concentrate on the next mogul, and over the course of the run,
they end up at the bottom of what others thought was an
impossible mountain.

The 18th century is called the Golden Age of botanical

greatest botanical artist of the time. Born in Heidelberg,
Germany, he was the son of a gardener who taught him much
about art and nature. As a young man, Ehret traveled around
Europe, largely on foot, observing plants and developing his
artistic skills. In Holland, he became acquainted with the
Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus. Through his collaborations with
Linnaeus and others, Ehret provided illustrations for a number
of significant horticultural publications. Ehret’s reputation for
scientific accuracy gained him many commissions from wealthy
patrons, particularly in England, where he eventually settled.

During the early stages when the aquaculture industry was
rapidly expanding, mistakes were made and these were costly
both in terms of direct losses and in respect of the industry’s
image. High-density rearing led to outbreaks of infectious
diseases that in some cases (1) devastated not just the caged
fish, but local wild fish populations too. The negative impact
on local wildlife inhabiting areas (2) close to the fish farms
continues to be an ongoing public relations problem for the
industry. Furthermore, a general lack of knowledge and
insufficient care being taken when fish pens were initially
constructed (3) meaning that pollution from excess feed and
fish waste created huge barren underwater deserts. These were
costly lessons to learn, but now stricter regulations are in
place to ensure that fish pens are placed in sites (4) where there
is good water flow to remove fish waste. This, in addition to
other methods that decrease the overall amount of uneaten
food, (5) has helped aquaculture to clean up its act.

While the eye sees at the surface, the ear tends to penetrate
below the surface. Joachim-Ernst Berendt points out that the ear
is the only sense that (A) fuses / replaces an ability to measure
with an ability to judge. We can discern different colors, but
we can give a precise number to different sounds. Our eyes do
not let us perceive with this kind of (B) diversity / precision . An
unmusical person can recognize an octave and, perhaps once
instructed, a quality of tone, that is, a C or an F-sharp. Berendt
points out that there are few ‘acoustical illusions’ ― something
sounding like something that in fact it is not ― while there are
many optical illusions. The ears do not lie. The sense of
hearing gives us a remarkable connection with the invisible,
underlying order of things. Through our ears we gain access to
vibration, which (C) underlies / undermines everything around
us. The sense of tone and music in another’s voice gives us an
enormous amount of information about that person, about her
stance toward life, about her intentions.

31. The concept of humans doing multiple things at a time has
been studied by psychologists since the 1920s, but the term
“multitasking” didn’t exist until the 1960s. It was used to
describe computers, not people. Back then, ten megahertz was
so fast that a new word was needed to describe a computer’s
ability to quickly perform many tasks. In retrospect, they
probably made a poor choice, for the expression “multitasking”
is inherently deceptive. Multitasking is about multiple tasks
alternately sharing one resource (the CPU), but in time the
context was flipped and it became interpreted to mean multiple
tasks being done simultaneously by one resource (a person). It
was a clever turn of phrase that’s misleading, for even
computers can process only one piece of code at a time. When
they “multitask,” they switch back and forth, alternating their
attention until both tasks are done. The speed with which
computers tackle multiple tasks that
everything happens at the same time, so comparing computers
to humans can be confusing. [3점]

32. My friend was disappointed that scientific progress has not
cured the world’s ills by abolishing wars and starvation; that
gross human inequality is still widespread; that happiness is
not universal. My friend made a common mistake ― a basic
misunderstanding in the nature of knowledge. Knowledge is
amoral ― not immoral but morality neutral. It can be used for
any purpose, but many people assume it will be used to further
their favorite hopes for society ― and this is the fundamental flaw.
Knowledge of the world is one thing; its uses create a separate
issue. To be disappointed that our progress in understanding
has not remedied the social ills of the world is a legitimate
view, but .
To argue that knowledge is not progressing because of the
African or Middle Eastern conflicts misses the point. There is
nothing inherent in knowledge that dictates any specific social
or moral application. [3점]
(1) to confuse this with the progress of knowledge is absurd
(2) to know the nature of knowledge is to practice its moral value
(3) to remove social inequality is the inherent purpose of knowledge
(4) to accumulate knowledge is to enhance its social application
(5) to make science progress is to make it cure social ills

33. According to a renowned French scholar, the growth in the
size and complexity of human populations was the driving
force in the evolution of science. Early, small communities had
to concentrate all their physical and mental effort on survival;
their thoughts were focused on food and religion. As
communities became larger, some people had time to reflect
and debate. They found that they could understand and predict
events better if they reduced passion and prejudice, replacing
these with observation and inference. But while a large
population may have been necessary, in itself it was not
sufficient for science to germinate. Some empires were big,
but the rigid social control required to hold an empire together
was not beneficial to science, just as it was not beneficial to
reason. The early nurturing and later flowering of science
to support
original thought and freewheeling incentive. The rise in
commerce and the decline of authoritarian religion allowed
science to follow reason in seventeenth-century Europe. [3점]

New media can be defined by four characteristics
simultaneously: they are media at the turn of the 20th and 21st
centuries which are both integrated and interactive and use
digital code and hypertext as technical means. It follows that
their most common alternative names are multimedia,
interactive media and digital media. By using this definition,
it is easy to identify media as old or new. (A) ,
traditional television is integrated as it contains images, sound
and text, but it is not interactive or based on digital code. The
plain old telephone was interactive, but not integrated as it
only transmitted speech and sounds and it did not work with
digital code. In contrast, the new medium of interactive
television adds interactivity and digital code. (B) ,
the new generations of mobile or fixed telephony are fully
digitalized and integrated as they add text, pictures or video
and they are connected to the Internet.

A currently popular attitude is to blame technology or
technologists for having brought on the environmental
problems we face today, and thus to try to slow technological
advance by blocking economic growth. We believe this view
to be thoroughly misguided. (1) If technology produced
automobiles that pollute the air, it is because pollution was not
recognized as a problem which engineers had to consider in
their designs. (2) Solar energy can be a practical alternative
energy source for us in the foreseeable future. (3) Obviously,
technology that produces pollution is generally cheaper, but
now that it has been decided that cleaner cars are wanted, less
polluting cars will be produced; cars which scarcely pollute at
all could even be made. (4) This last option, however, would
require several years and much investment. (5) Although
technology is responsive to the will of the people, it can
seldom respond instantaneously and is never free.

The impact of color has been studied for decades. For
example, in a factory, the temperature was maintained at
72℉ and the walls were painted a cool blue-green. The
employees complained of the cold.
(A) The psychological effects of warm and cool hues seem to
be used effectively by the coaches of the Notre Dame
football team. The locker rooms used for half-time breaks
were reportedly painted to take advantage of the
emotional impact of certain hues.
(B) The home-team room was painted a bright red, which
kept team members excited or even angered. The
visiting-team room was painted a blue-green, which had a
calming effect on the team members. The success of this
application of color can be noted in the records set by
Notre Dame football teams.
(C) The temperature was maintained at the same level, but the
walls were painted a warm coral. The employees stopped
complaining about the temperature and reported they
were quite comfortable.

The researchers had made this happen by lengthening the
period of daylight to which the peach trees on whose roots
the insects fed were exposed.
Exactly how cicadas keep track of time has always intrigued
researchers, and it has always been assumed that the insects
must rely on an internal clock. Recently, however, one group
of scientists working with the 17-year cicada in California
have suggested that the nymphs use an external cue and that
they can count. ( (1) ) For their experiments they took
15-year-old nymphs and moved them to an experimental
enclosure. ( (2) ) These nymphs should have taken a further
two years to emerge as adults, but in fact they took just one
year. ( (3) ) By doing this, the trees were “tricked” into
flowering twice during the year rather than the usual once.
( (4) ) Flowering in trees coincides with a peak in amino acid
concentrations in the sap that the insects feed on. ( (5) ) So it
seems that the cicadas keep track of time by counting the
peaks.

They also rated how generally extroverted those fake
extroverts appeared, based on their recorded voices and
body language.
Some years ago, a psychologist named Richard Lippa called
a group of introverts to his lab and asked them to act like
extroverts while pretending to teach a math class. ( (1) ) Then
he and his team, with video cameras in hand, measured the
length of their strides, the amount of eye contact they made
with their “students,” the percentage of time they spent
talking, and the volume of their speech. ( (2) ) Then Lippa
did the same thing with actual extroverts and compared the
results. ( (3) ) He found that although the latter group came
across as more extroverted, some of the fake extroverts were
surprisingly convincing. ( (4) ) It seems that most of us
know how to fake it to some extent. ( (5) ) Whether or not
we’re aware that the length of our strides and the amount of
time we spend talking and smiling mark us as introverts and
extroverts, we know it unconsciously. [3점]

Plato and Tolstoy both assume that it can be firmly
established that certain works have certain effects. Plato is
sure that the representation of cowardly people makes us
cowardly; the only way to prevent this effect is to suppress
such representations. Tolstoy is confident that the artist
who sincerely expresses feelings of pride will pass those
feelings on to us; we can no more escape than we could
escape an infectious disease. In fact, however, the effects
of art are neither so certain nor so direct. People vary a
great deal both in the intensity of their response to art and
in the form which that response takes. Some people may
indulge fantasies of violence by watching a film instead of
working out those fantasies in real life. Others may be
disgusted by even glamorous representations of violence.
Still others may be left unmoved, neither attracted nor
disgusted.

Increased size affects group life in a number of ways. There
is evidence that larger groups (five or six members) are more
productive than smaller groups (two or three members).
Members of larger groups tend to offer more suggestions than
members of smaller groups, and although they seem to reach
less agreement, they also show less tension. These differences
may reflect the greater need of larger groups to solve
organizational problems. Members may realize that their
behavior must become more goal-directed, since it is unlikely
that they can coordinate their actions without making a special
effort to do so. Larger groups also put more pressure on their
members to conform. In such groups, it is harder for everyone
to take part equally in discussions or to have the same amount
of influence on decisions.
There is evidence that groups with an even number of
members differ from groups with an odd number of members.
The former disagree more than the latter and suffer more
deadlocks as a result. Groups with an even number of
members may split into halves. This is impossible in groups
with an odd number of members ― one side always has a
numerical advantage. According to some researchers, the
number five has special significance. Groups of this size
usually the problems we have just outlined.
Moreover, they are not plagued by the fragility and tensions
found in groups of two or three. Groups of five rate high in
member satisfaction; because of the odd number of members,
deadlocks are unlikely when disagreements occur.

(A)
In my office, I have a framed letter from a couple of children
I have never met. The letter holds a special significance for me.
It reads, “Dear Dr. Brown, thanks for teaching Mr. Wills to
teach Tisha and Kelly.” Mr. Wills is Jeremy Wills, and (a) he is
one of my former students. A few years back, he took my
positive psychology class in college.
(B)
Before long, the reality hit Jeremy hard. Even after
spending many hours each day preparing lesson plans, it
became clear that his methods were not working. One of the
worst moments was when (b) he distributed a math test.
Many students didn’t even look at the exam. They just put
their heads on their desks and slept. Jeremy became so
stressed that he even dreaded going into his classroom.
(C)
After graduation, Jeremy joined an organization that
recruits future leaders to teach in low-income communities.
(c) He was assigned to a small school in a poor rural county
in North Carolina. Later, his assistant principal took note of
Jeremy’s high expectations and asked him to take over (d) his
math class. He took charge of about a dozen failing “special ed”
kids, and Tisha and Kelly were among them. His idealism
ran high, and he thought he would be able to magically fix
all of their problems.
(D)
Jeremy knew something had to change. (e) He then thought
back to my class, remembering how negative emotions can
drag you down, leaving positive emotions unnoticed. That’s
when he decided to focus more on building positive attitudes
within the classroom. He borrowed lessons from my positive
psychology class and even mentioned my name to his students.
As the students’ attitudes became more optimistic, their
confidence with math grew too. At the end of the school year,
80 percent of Jeremy’s students passed the state’s math test.
