I have always been a huge fan of Redbug Cameras.
However, when I purchased your newest model, the
Superimage 2000, I could not have been more disappointed.
I acquired it on June 3rd of this year and it does not
function correctly. The camera lens does not focus properly
and the resulting photos are blurry and unclear. I went to the
local service center to get it repaired, but the poor service
I received there only complicated the problem. I am
extremely frustrated with the poor quality repairs that were
made in addition to the overall inferior quality of the
camera. I insist on receiving a full refund. Enclosed is a
copy of the original receipt and the repair bill.

Henri Matisse came late to painting, having trained to be
a lawyer to please his father. While he was in the hospital
recovering from surgery, his mother brought (1) him a box
of paints and a how-to book, and the world lost an attorney
and gained an artist. “It was as if (2) I had been called,” he
remembered. “Henceforth I did not lead my life. It led me.”
Matisse left for Paris to study art, with his father shouting,
“Do you want (3) me to see you starve?” He gained fame
as leader of the Fauves’ 1905 show. In 1917 Matisse began
to spend winters in Vence, where he donated a chapel of
(4) his own design that is one of the most moving religious
buildings in Europe. After local nuns nursed (5) him through
a serious illness in the 1940s, the grateful Matisse devoted
himself to every detail of the chapel.

Deseada is a small island which belongs to the Lesser
Antilles. This island is said to have obtained its name
from the desire Christopher Columbus felt of seeing land
on his second voyage in 1493. It is twelve miles in length

is lower than (A) it / that which looks to the south. The
island abounds greatly in iguanas, and in a species of
birds called fragatas. There is a deep cavern on the
island, containing the bones and arms of the Indians,
who, it is supposed, (B) was / were buried there. In 1762,
this island was taken by the English, (C) who / where

If you’ve ever gone snorkeling, you may (1) have seen an
amazing sight: an entire school of fish suddenly changes
direction as one unit. The same goes for flocks of birds. So
are they all following the commands of a leader? Researchers
have determined that there is no leader or controlling force.
Rather, the individual fish or bird is reacting (2) almost
instantly to the movements of its neighbors in the school or
flock. (3) Any individual can initiate a movement, such as a
change in direction, and this sends out a “maneuver wave,”
which spreads through the group at an astounding speed.
Because individuals can see, or sense, the wave (4) coming
toward them, they are ready to react more quickly than they
would without such advance notice. (5) That appears to us as
simultaneous is actually a kind of “follow your neighbor”
behavior moving faster than the eye can see.

22. To require perfection is to invite paralysis. The pattern
is predictable: as you see error in what you have done, you
steer your work toward what you imagine you can do
perfectly. You cling ever more tightly to what you already
know you can do ― away from risk and exploration, and
possibly further from the work of your heart. You find
reasons to delay, since to not work is to not make mistakes.
Believing that your work should be perfect, you gradually
become convinced that you cannot do it. (You are correct.)
Sooner or later, since you cannot do what you are trying to
do, you quit. And in one of those little ironies of life, only
the pattern itself achieves perfection ― a perfect death spiral:
you misdirect your work; you stall; you quit.
(1) 지나친 모험심을 멀리해야 한다.
(2) 완벽에 집착하면 일을 그르친다.
(3) 기존 방식에서도 배울 점이 있다.
(4) 처음부터 완벽한 계획을 세워야 한다.
(5) 서두르지 않아야 실수를 줄일 수 있다.
23. A man standing on the street corner selling “nonbreakable”
pens suddenly finds that the one he is demonstrating with
breaks in half. He stops for a moment, turns to the crowd,
and declares, “Now I’ll show you what the inside looks
like.” Laughter can turn any disadvantage into an advantage.
People who know this not only look for some positive aspect
in their misfortunes but actually go one step further. After
their initial shock, they gather their resources, overcome their
problem, and see opportunities where most of us fail to see
them. Moreover, many who have experienced a major loss
often go on to achieve remarkable feats in spite of their
hardships, because they focus on what they can gain from
their circumstance rather than on what they have lost. They
believe in the old cliché that every cloud has a silver lining,
and they actively seek the advantage in their disadvantage.

24. The sun is slowly getting brighter as its core contracts and
heats up. In a billion years it will be about 10 percent brighter
than today, heating the planet to an uncomfortable degree.
Water evaporating from the oceans may set off a runaway
greenhouse effect that turns Earth into a damp version of
Venus, wrapped permanently in a thick, white blanket of cloud.
Or the transformation may take some time and be more gentle,
with an increasingly hot and cloudy atmosphere able to shelter
microbial life for some time. Either way, water will escape into
the stratosphere and be broken down by UV light into oxygen
and hydrogen. Oxygen will be left in the stratosphere ―
perhaps misleading aliens into thinking the planet is still
inhabited ― while the hydrogen is light enough to escape into
space. So our water will gradually .

25. Imagine a child playing on the beach below a cliff. He finds
a cave, and full of excitement, goes in. Suddenly fear seizes
him. In the deep dark of the cave, he cannot see the way ahead.
What is frightening him is the sense of the unknown stretching
into the black distance. Worries can be like this. Our anxiety
is not about something specific, but more of a sense that
unknown and uncertain possibilities may be out of sight far
ahead. We can stop these worries from growing. A powerful
torch or flashlight could have shown the child the limits of
the cave. We can by
asking: “What is the worst that can happen?” More often than
not, the worst that we fear is much less terrible than our vague,
unarticulated fear. Once we know the worst, we can face it
directly and work out more sensibly what to do.
(1) hide our fears
(2) increase our uncertainties
(3) place limits on our worries
(4) share specific worries with others
(5) differentiate reality from the ideal
26. People have found many ways to reduce stress or control
their responses to it. Possibilities include special breathing
routines, exercise, meditation, and distraction, as well as
trying to deal with the problem that caused the stress.
Social support is one of the most powerful methods of
coping with stress, and researchers have demonstrated its
effectiveness by brain measurements as well as people’s
self-reports. In one study, happily married women were
given moderately painful shocks to their ankles. On various
trials, they held the hand of their husband, a man they did
not know, or no one. Holding the husband’s hand reduced
the response in several brain areas. Holding the hand of an
unknown man reduced the response a little, on the average,
but not as much as holding the husband’s hand. In short, as
expected, brain responses correspond to people’s self-reports
that .
(1) holding hands makes them feel friendlier
(2) exercise and meditation lessen ankle pain
(3) stimulating the brain induces happier feelings
(4) what matters the most is how to measure stress
(5) social support from a loved one helps reduce stress
27. Lifeline infrastructures are vital systems that support a
nation’s economy and quality of life. Modern economies
rely on the ability to move goods, people, and information
safely and reliably. Adding to their importance is that
many of the lifeline systems serve vital roles in disaster
recovery. Consequently, it is of the utmost importance to
government, business, and the public at large that the
flow of services provided by a nation’s infrastructure
continues unimpeded in the face of a broad range of
natural and technological hazards. The linkage between
systems and services is critical to any discussion of
infrastructure. Although it is the performance of the
hardware (i.e., the highways, pipes, and transmission lines)
that is of immediate concern following an earthquake, it
is actually the loss of services that these systems provide
that is the real loss to the public. Therefore, a high
priority in protecting these systems from hazards is
ensuring ___________________________________.
(1) an early alarm system for economic crises
(2) the durability and stability of transmission lines
(3) the continuity, or at least the rapid restoration, of service
(4) a prompt mobilization of experts for disaster control
(5) the maintenance and expansion of lifeline systems
28. Essentially the same structural forms of politics can
nevertheless take on very different “flavors.” For example,
a dictatorship can, in theory, be brutal or benevolent;
anarchy can, in theory, consist of “mutual aid” or a “war
of all against all” that proceeds in the absence of any rule
of law whatsoever; democracies can and typically are
distinguished in terms of the extent to which they are
socially oriented as opposed to individualistically oriented.
Thus, whatever our answer to the “What is the best
structural form of politics?” question, we still want to know
what “flavor” this structural form of politics ought to have
since . Indeed,
this is precisely why we vote within a democratic structure: to
determine the “flavor” we want that democratic structure to
have. [3점]
(1) voters ultimately determine a political structure
(2) political structures, in fact, outweigh political “flavors”
(3) the best structural form of politics is not easy to determine
(4) political structure, by itself, does not determine political content
(5) each structural form of politics must be valued independently

29. The greatest errors in judging a person are made by his
parents; this is a fact, but how is one to explain it? Do the
parents have too much experience of the child, and can they
no longer compose it into a unity? We notice that travelers
in a strange land grasp correctly the common, distinctive
traits of a people only in the first period of their stay; the
more they get to know a people, the more they (A)
how to see what is typical and distinctive about it. As soon
as they see up close, they stop being farsighted. Might
parents judge their children wrongly because they have
never stood far enough off from them? A quite different
explanation would be the following: people tend to stop
thinking about things that are closest to them, and simply
(B) them. When parents are required to judge their
children, it is perhaps their customary thoughtlessness that
makes them judge so mistakenly. [3점]

30. Persuasion is the strategic use of language to move an
audience. It works by appealing to our emotion as well as
by appealing to our reason. Therefore, sometimes you
may try to appeal to an emotion in your audience by
imitating it: hysteria by being hysterical, anger by raging.
(A) , you may try to re-create the circumstances
which excited in you the emotions that you want to excite in
your audience. However, the best measure is to appear calm,
detached, thoroughly in control of your feelings, while
you are controlling your narrative for your own purposes.
Even your choice of words should be selective; you must pay
attention to their nuances. If you address a labor union,
(B) , it will make a great difference whether you
refer to the members as workers, comrades, or just people.

The growing season in the Arctic region is short as well
as cool, and plants must make the most of what warmth there
is. One (A) addiction / adaptation by many arctic plants to
the short growing season is wintergreen, or semi-evergreen,

survive through winter without drying up and dying. They
remain green and can start photosynthesis as soon as the
weather is warm enough in spring, before there has been time
for the new season’s leaves to expand and start functioning.
They finally (B) wither / prosper after the new leaves have
taken over. There are many common arctic plants with

Organic food production is growing by leaps and bounds.
Many consumers are willing to pay premium prices for organic
foods, convinced that they are helping the earth and eating
healthier. Some experts say, however, that organic farming has
some (1) drawbacks. One of the most frequent criticisms is
that the crop yields of organic farms are much (2) lower than
those of traditional farms. That’s because organic fields suffer
more from weeds and insects than (3) conventional fields.
Another argument often offered by experts is that organic
farming can supply food for niche markets of (4) wealthy
consumers but cannot feed billions of hungry people around
the globe. Only the careful use of chemical inputs, not the
costly organic methods, can help (5) reduce food production
significantly in the countries facing hunger.

33. What everyday rules for behavior guide parents’ efforts
to socialize their toddlers and preschool-age children? To
answer this question, Gralinski and Kopp observed and
interviewed mothers and their children in these age groups.
They found that for fifteen-month-olds, mothers’ rules and
requests centered on ensuring the children’s safety and, to a
lesser extent, protecting the families’ possessions from harm;
respecting basic social niceties (“Don’t bite”; “No kicking”);
and learning to delay getting what they wanted. As children’s
ages and cognitive sophistication increased, the numbers and
kinds of prohibitions and requests expanded from the original
focus on child protection and interpersonal issues to family
routines, self-care, and other concerns regarding the child’s
independence. By the time children were three, a new quality
of rule emerged: “Do not scream in a restaurant, run around
naked in front of company, or pick your nose.”
(1) changes in maternal rules according to children’s age
(2) limitations of discipline for children’s socialization
(3) parents’ concerns about children’s independence
(4) importance of parents’ anger management skills
(5) effects of thinking ability on children’s socialization
34. Ancient Greek and Roman costume is essentially draped,
and presents a traditional stability and permanence. While it
received certain fashions over the centuries, it never
underwent any major transformation. Léon Heuzey, the
pioneer of the study of classical costume, set forth with
exemplary clarity its two basic principles: the first is that
Classical costume has no form in itself, as it consisted of
a simple rectangular piece of cloth woven in varying sizes
according to its intended use and the height of the customer,
without differentiation between the sexes; the second is that
this cloth is always draped, never shaped or cut, and was
worn round the body in accordance with definite rules. Thus
it was always fluid and ‘live.’ It is notable that we find no
evidence in Classical times of tailors or dressmakers: the
word itself barely exists in Greek or Latin.

This graph shows the number of U.S. Science and
Engineering (S & E) doctoral degrees earned by students
from China, India, South Korea, and Taiwan from 1987 to
2007. (1) In 1987, Taiwan had the largest number of S & E
doctoral degree recipients from U.S. institutions while China
had the least. (2) However, China quickly caught up to the
other countries by 1990, and has since produced the most
U.S. S & E doctoral degree recipients of the four Asian
countries. (3) Between 2001 and 2005, more U.S. S & E
doctorates were given to South Korean students than to their
Indian peers. (4) What is noticeable is that since the early
1990s, all four countries have consistently showed a steady
increase in the number of U.S. S & E doctoral degree
recipients. (5) From 1987 to 2007, none of the four Asian
countries broke the barrier of receiving 5,000 U.S. S & E
doctorates in a single year, but China came closest when it
received 4,500 in 2007.

Patience Lovell Wright was a successful artist who specialized
in creating wax figures of famous people. Although Patience
had received little formal education and what she knew
about art was mostly self-taught, she was very skilled, and
her work quickly became popular. She was also a devoted
Patriot. When the war broke out, she immediately began to
work for the Continental Army. She easily picked up
information not only from her clients but also from women
with whom she socialized often. Patience thrived on danger.
Toward the end of the American Revolution, she became
deeply involved in a plot to overthrow the king. Without
financial backing, the plotters were forced to abandon their
plan. Patience consoled herself by recognizing the part she
had played in the American Revolution as one of the
Patriots’ most colorful spies.

The small jerboa lives in deserts across the world. Jerboas
have big eyes and, like many desert animals, they can see
very well at night. In the late evening, they come out of
their holes and look for food ― mostly seeds and plants.
Jerboas are very well adapted to life in the desert. Some
jerboas do not need to drink, because they get water from
their food. In the hot summer, some jerboas sleep under the
sand for two or three months. Jerboas also live in cold
deserts like the Gobi. Here, they sleep in their holes in the
winter and stay away from the snow. Jerboas can move
very fast across the sand. They have huge back legs and
they can jump up to three meters in one move. They do
this when they need to run away from other animals.

I am a female dolphin who lives in an aquarium. One day
I got so badly injured that I couldn’t swim and come up for
air. So my trainers attached bottles to me to act as floats.
I didn’t want to live the rest of my life being supported by
these bottles. I was so aimless and dispirited. I merely
floated about and was sure I wasn’t going to live for very
long. Seeing my depression, my trainers brought in a male
dolphin. At first I ignored him but later began to show
interest. He tried to help me swim, pushing me from under
and bringing me to the surface. Despite my injury, I began
making an effort to swim. Soon, the bottles were removed
and I recovered completely. It felt great to swim on my
own again. We became inseparable, swimming joyfully
around together and showing signs of affection.

39. The streets of New York are home to numerous trucks,
vans, stands, and pushcarts all selling food. Most of the
vendors are immigrants bringing street versions of the
world’s diverse food traditions to this already international
metropolis. You can snack on Jamaican goat patties, sample
Chinese noodles, take a bite of Egyptian falafel, or enjoy
vegetarian Sri Lankan curry. New York even has an annual
award ceremony, the Vendy Awards, for the best sidewalk
chefs. Part of the fun is tracking down the best offerings.
Trucks and vans often visit different areas of New York on
different days; some chefs operate only at certain times of
day or only on weekends. Even stands with regular spots and
hours occasionally vanish, as the owner finds a better spot
or takes a week off. Follow the crowds, or ask locals for
information ― hotel doormen will often let you into the
secrets of a neighborhood’s best vendors.

40. Fourteenth-century approaches to music had a profound
and continuing impact on music in later centuries. Perhaps
most significant was the invention of a precise and
unambiguous notation that could record a wide variety of
rhythms and allowed music to be distributed in writing and
performed accurately wherever it went. We now take this
for granted when we play from notation and sight-read through
unfamiliar music, but it was a remarkable innovation in the
fourteenth century. Among its effects was that composers
could fix their music exactly as they wished it to be
performed, leading them to take pride in authorship. The
increased interest in the individual and in satisfying the
human senses that was characteristic of the age grew
stronger in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and has
remained important ever since.

reciprocation. (1) The rule requires that one person try to
repay, in kind, what another person has provided. (2) By
obligating the recipient of an act to repayment in the future,
the rule for reciprocation allows one individual to give
something to another with confidence that it is not being lost.
(3) Sociologists have a desire to be consistent with their
words, beliefs, attitudes, and deeds. (4) This sense of future
obligation within the rule makes possible the development
of various kinds of continuing relationships, transactions, and
exchanges that are beneficial to the society. (5) Consequently,
all members of the society are trained from childhood to
follow the rule or suffer serious social disapproval.

42. Several plane crashes and near crashes have been attributed
to dangerous downward wind bursts known as wind shear.
These wind bursts generally result from high-speed downdrafts
in the turbulence of thunderstorms, but they can occur in
clear air when rain evaporates high above the ground. (1) The
downdraft spreads out when it hits the ground and forms an
inward circular pattern. (2) A plane entering the pattern
experiences an unexpected upward headwind that lifts the
plane. (3) Special radar systems are being installed at major
airports to detect the location of unpredictable thunderstorms.
(4) To resist it, the pilot often cuts speed and lowers the
plane’s nose to compensate. (5) Further into the circular
pattern, the wind quickly turns downward, and an airplane
can suddenly lose altitude and possibly crash when it is near
the ground, as upon landing.
* wind shear: 갑자기 방향이 바뀌는 돌풍

The underlying idea of world history is that the interaction
among human societies resembles not the relationships
among billiard balls, but rather among bacteria.
(A) Similarly, human societies in contact affect each other’s
development. World historians, recognizing this, seek
to understand human history through studying both
developments within societies and the way in which
societies relate to each other.
(B) Bacteria, however, fundamentally shape each other as
they interact. Because the membranes covering bacteria
are full of pores, bacteria can exchange genetic
information and can even fundamentally alter each
other’s basic make-up when they touch.

In one troop, a taste for caramels was developed by
introducing this new food into the diet of young minors,
low on the status ladder.
We are not the only species to give sometimes wrongheaded
deference to those in authority positions. ( (1) ) In monkey
colonies, where rigid dominance hierarchies exist, beneficial
innovations do not spread quickly through the group unless
they are taught first to a dominant animal. ( (2) ) When a
lower animal is taught the new concept first, the rest of the
colony remains mostly oblivious to its value. ( (3) ) One
study on the introduction of new food tastes to Japanese
monkeys provides a nice illustration. ( (4) ) The taste for
caramels inched slowly up the ranks: A year and a half later,
only 51 percent of the colony had acquired it, and still none
of the leaders. ( (5) ) Contrast this with what happened in a
second troop where wheat was introduced first to the leader:
Wheat eating ― to this point unknown to these monkeys ―

All art is creation, regardless of how closely the
imitation approximates the original. Even the most
rigorous attempt to create an absolute likeness is
ultimately selective. Doing a portrait, for example, the
artist may ask the subject to look serious, not smile ―
selecting a certain aspect of the person. We know Mona
Lisa Giaconda, the subject of the most famous portrait
in the world, through her mysterious smile; but we will
never know what the entire person was like. The
treasure of art, however, is that its reality lives forever.
The final product is really an addition to reality, not
simply a way of totally reproducing it. The artist always
contributes something new, something that never was
put together in precisely that way before. Leonardo’s
Mona Lisa is not Mona Lisa. The latter has long since
gone to her reward; the former will never die.

The first memory I have of visiting a working artist’s
studio is a trip my family took to the studio of (a) Grey
Stone, a potter who made the dinnerware set our whole
family has cherished for many years. When I was about
five years old, our family drove down to his studio
with several miscellaneous pieces of handmade pottery
from the family collection. We wanted Grey to make a
set that would draw together the pieces we had collected
over the years.
(B)
A favorite family pastime then developed when guests
came over and we got out the “good stoneware.” Before
my father served the food, (b) he would encourage
guests to flip over their plates to read what was on the
underside. Thanks to his influence, this childhood pastime
has since become a habit. Even today, I still flip over
all handmade pottery pieces as soon as I first touch
them to see if there might be an inscription or at least
to look for the potter’s mark.
(C)
Even at that young age, looking around Grey’s house
and studio complex, I thought about how great it was that
he could work at home, with (c) his family around him,
and produce things with his own hands. After accepting
our request, he immediately started working on one of the
pieces. Taking a prepared lump of clay, (d) he put it on
his treadle wheel. It was so fascinating to see how
ordinary clay could turn into a beautiful pot.
(D)
I couldn’t get that process out of my head so I looked
forward to our return trip several months later to pick up
the finished dinnerware. One of my favorite features of
each piece Grey had made was that, upon close
inspection, one could see that the pieces had been
individually inscribed with some marks on the underside,
just inside the trimmed foot. On each of those pieces,
with the large foot area, there was room for the
inscription not only of (e) the potter’s signature, address,
and date, but also a unique saying or phrase.

All his life, Chris Greicius dreamed of becoming a
police officer. But there was a major obstacle standing
in his way. He had leukemia and was not expected to
make it to adulthood. When he was seven years old,
Chris’s disease got worse. That’s when a family friend,
Tommy Austin, arranged for Chris to come as close as
he could to . He called
Officer Ron Cox and arranged for Chris to spend a day
with some police officers.
When the day arrived, Chris was welcomed by three
squad cars and a police motorcycle ridden by Officer
Frank Shankwitz. Then, he was treated to a ride in a
police helicopter. The officers finished the day by
swearing Chris in as the first ― and only ― honorary
state trooper. The next day, Cox presented Chris with an
official Arizona Highway Patrol uniform. With a smile
that lit up the room, he accepted it.
Two days later, Chris died in the hospital, his uniform
close at hand. Shankwitz was very sad, but grateful that
he had helped Chris. He also realized that there were
many other children like Chris. That prompted Shankwitz
to co-found the Make-A-Wish Foundation. It has now
become the largest wish-granting organization in the world,
enlarging the experiences of more than eighty thousand
children.

Today, the world of innovation is far different from what

Traditionally, intellectual property has played little role in

22. We often dismiss new ideas that could further our growth
simply because they do not fit within the general framework

amount of time is spent simply reacting. It’s as if we are
robots programmed to respond on cue to whatever demands
the least time and attention, and disregard anything that
requires putting in extra time and energy to think. We skim
over the surface thoughtlessly. But we must acknowledge
that thinking well is a time-consuming process. We can’t
expect instant results. We have to slow down a bit and take
the time to contemplate and meditate. It is the only path to
a more meaningful and efficient existence.

how well you believe you are disguising yourself, others
always know. The consequences are that you waste energy,
sacrifice productivity, and lose people’s trust. In our study,
all of the CEOs were concerned that dropping their masks
would make them appear weak. In every case, however, the
leader’s subordinates perceived the removal of the mask as
an act of strength and courage. This, in turn, encouraged a
culture where those subordinates did the same, creating a
snowball effect. Some of the ways we helped the CEOs
remove their masks were to actually name the masks,
explore the significant personal and professional costs of
upholding them, and ask the CEOs to reflect on the leader
they most admired. At this point each of the CEOs was ready
to rebuild a leadership identity based on values, strengths,
and ambitions.

24. When we behave irrationally, our behavior usually seems
reasonable to us. When challenged, the mind says (to itself),
“Why are these people giving me a hard time? I’m just doing
what makes sense. Any reasonable person would see that!”
In short, we naturally think that our thinking is fully justified.
As far as we can tell, we are only doing what is right and
proper and reasonable. Any fleeting thoughts suggesting that
we might be at fault typically are by more
powerful self-justifying thoughts: “I don’t mean any harm.
I’m just! I’m fair! It’s the others who are wrong!” It is
important to recognize this nature of the human mind as its

Or their attempts to discourage it are milder. This is not an

26. It is a common misconception among many musicians and
non-musicians alike that .
This is not surprising as it is natural to associate music with
the sounds that create the melody, rather than with the quiet
spaces between the notes. Because rests are silent, people
often misinterpret these empty spaces as unimportant. But,
imagine what would happen if a song was made up of only
notes, and no rests. Aside from the fact that the “rests would
be history” (pun intended), there would be a wall of sound
with no reference point or discernible backbone to the music.
This is because the spaces between the sounds provide a
baseline and contrast for the piece, and give music structure
and texture. In fact, it is a common saying among experienced
musicians that a full measure of rest can hold more music
than a full measure of blistering notes. [3점]
(1) notes are more important than rests
(2) rests provide a direct reference point to music
(3) silence is no less meaningful than sound in music
(4) melody is nothing more than a collection of sounds
(5) structure and texture are the most crucial aspects of music

27. Cost estimates follow from time estimates simply by

Beware of . For
example, one major company has a policy that requires the
following personnel in order to remove an electric motor: a
tinsmith to remove the cover, an electrician to disconnect
the electrical supply, a millwright to unbolt the mounts, and
one or more laborers to remove the motor from its mount.
That situation is fraught with inefficiency and high labor
costs, since all four trades must be scheduled together, with
at least three people watching while the fourth is at work.
The cost will be at least four times what it could be and is
often greater if one of the trades does not show up on time.
* fraught: ～으로 가득 찬

(3) differences in labor skills when working in groups

directions from locals. We try to tough it out with map and
compass. Admitting being lost feels like admitting stupidity.
This is a stereotype, but it has a large grain of truth. It’s
also a good metaphor for a big overlooked problem in the
human sciences. We’re trying to find our way around the dark
continent of human nature. We scientists are being paid to
be the bus-driving tour guides for the rest of humanity. They
expect us to know our way around the human mind, but we
don’t. So we try to fake it, without asking the locals for
directions. We try to find our way from first principles of
geography (‘theory’), and from maps of our own making
(‘empirical research’). The roadside is crowded with locals,
and their brains are crowded with local knowledge, but we
are too arrogant and embarrassed to ask the way. So we drive
around in circles,
about where to find the scenic vistas that would entertain and
enlighten the tourists. [3점]

One of the most commonly cited reasons for keeping a pet
animal is for the companionship it can provide. The general
term companionship usually translates into partaking in
shared activities, such as walking the dog, playing with the
cat. However, such behavioral interactions between humans
and pet animals are usually asymmetrically organized.
Humans tend to interact with their pets when they feel like
it, rather than (A) consistently / occasionally responding to
the animal’s demands for attention. In addition, it is often
observed that once interaction between humans and pets has
arisen, the termination of such interactional sequences
invariably (B) originates / separates from the human. This
suggests that activities like walking the dog and playing with
the cat only arise when time can be spared from the human
owner’s other commitments. Therefore, if one views activity
as a global concept ― involving instigation, performance, and
termination ― labeling certain forms of human-pet interaction
as shared activities may be (C) appealing / misleading .
* instigation: (～하도록) 부추김
(A) (B) (C)
(1) consistently …… originates …… appealing
(2) consistently …… originates …… misleading
(3) consistently …… separates …… appealing
(4) occasionally …… originates …… misleading
(5) occasionally …… separates …… appealing

33. We sometimes encounter students who come to our offices
and ask how they could have worked so hard but still failed
our tests. They usually tell us that they read and reread the
textbook and their class notes, and that they thought they
understood everything well by the time of the exam. And they
probably did internalize some bits and pieces of the material,
but the illusion of knowledge led them to confuse the
familiarity they had gained from repeated exposure to the
concepts in the course with an actual understanding of them.
As a rule, reading text over and over again yields diminishing
returns in actual knowledge, but it increases familiarity and
fosters a false sense of understanding. Only by testing
ourselves can we actually determine whether or not we really
understand. That is one reason why teachers give tests, and
why the best tests probe knowledge at a deep level.
(1) positive impact of student counseling on study skills
(2) importance of familiarity in gaining actual understanding
(3) relationship between reading and gaining high test scores
(4) tests as a means to distinguish real understanding from
familiarity
(5) necessity of internalizing reading materials to improve test
scores
34. Hundreds of species of small fishes exist in well-defined
social organizations called schools. Fish schools vary in size
from a few individuals to enormous populations extending
over several square kilometers. Schools usually consist of a
single species, with all members similar in size or age. For
small animals with no other means of individual defense,
schooling behavior provides a degree of protection. Predatory
fishes have less chance of encountering prey if the prey are
members of a school because the individuals of the prey
species are concentrated in compact units rather than
dispersed over a much larger area. Moreover, once a predator
encounters a school, satiation of the predator enables most
members of the school to escape unharmed. Large numbers
of fishes in a school may achieve additional survival
advantages by confusing predators with continually shifting
and changing positions; they might even discourage hungry
predators with the illusion of an impressively large and
formidable opponent.
* satiation: 물릴 정도로 먹음, 포만
(1) protective instincts of small fish species
(2) origin of social organizations in small fishes
(3) fish schooling as a behavioral strategy for survival
(4) necessity of fish farms to save endangered species
(5) behavioral differences between predatory fishes and prey

Over the sky a plump black cloud moved, erasing the
stars. At that moment, Liz heard a stealthy step far to her
left and immediately froze. She slowly released her knees
and straightened her head, the better to hear. The movement
stopped, and after a long moment began again. Liz saw a
dark figure creep into the open and draw near to the trees.
The figure stood so still and low to the ground that it might
have been a stump. She called softly, “Tim!” Hearing an
answering whistle, she went toward her son and, with tears
of delight, hugged him tightly.

Imagine the Titanic floating overhead: That’s what it
would have been like to see the USS Macon fly by. Nearly
800 feet long, the airship was completed in 1933 as part of
an effort to equip the U.S. Navy with airborne military bases.
With an onboard hangar, Macon was capable of launching
five small fixed-wing planes in midair. But it never saw
action and went down off California’s Big Sur coast during
a storm in 1935. Rediscovered in 1980 when a fisherman
caught a piece of the airship’s debris in his net, the wreck
was recently surveyed and mapped using sonar and remotely
operated robots. Government archaeologists continue to
explore the unique site, which lies in 1,500 feet of water.

Warren McArthur graduated from Cornell in 1908 with a
degree in mechanical engineering. He began working in the
budding field of industrial design ― patenting ten lamps
between 1911 and 1914. He moved to Arizona in 1913,
where he and his brother opened car dealerships. Warren
originally ventured into furniture design and construction as
a hobby, but at age 44, he moved to Los Angeles to design
and manufacture metal furniture. He was among the
pioneers in the use of aluminum for furniture, and his
contribution included improvements and patents to facilitate
mass production. He relocated his factory back East to New
York in 1933 where he designed and manufactured unique
aluminum furniture.

39. Restoration assumes that one can recreate an artist’s
original intent and product. At best, restorers’ and museum
directors’ aesthetic preferences and historical theories drive
restorations, for it is impossible to step outside one’s historical
context. How can restorers be so sure that removing a layer
of lacquer isn’t merely their subconscious attempt to refashion
an artwork according to contemporary tastes? What’s
“restorative” about that? The “restored” Sistine Chapel may
look “authentic” today, but will it still look so when aesthetic
and historical theories have changed? Surely the best approach
with any great work of art is to simply leave it alone.

40. Your culture maintains an implicit “schedule” for the right
time to do many important things; for example, the right time
to start dating, to finish college, to buy your own home, or
to have a child. This unspoken timetable provides you with
a social clock, a schedule that tells you if you’re keeping
pace with your peers, are ahead of them, or are falling behind.
On the basis of this social clock, you evaluate your own social
and professional development. If you keep up with the rest
of your peers, then you’ll feel well adjusted, competent, and
a part of the group. If you’re late, you’ll probably experience
feelings of dissatisfaction. Although in some cultures the social
clock is becoming more flexible and more tolerant of deviations
from the conventional timetable, it still exerts pressure to keep
pace with your peers.

Economic distance relates to the time and cost involved in
traveling from the origin to the destination area and back.
The higher the economic distance, the higher the resistance
for that destination and, consequently, the lower the demand.
(1) It follows, conversely, that between any origin and
destination point, if the travel time or travel cost can be
reduced, demand will increase. (2) Many excellent examples
of this are available, such as the introduction of the jet plane
in 1959 and the introduction of the wide-bodied jets in the
late 1960s. (3) Jet planes first cut travel time between
California and Hawaii, for example, from twelve hours to
five hours, and demand grew dramatically. (4) A similar
surge in demand was experienced with the introduction of
the wide-bodied planes for transatlantic flights. (5) The
agricultural products picked up from Hawaiian farms in the
morning were on dinner tables in Californian homes by
evening. The introduction of these planes cut the travel cost
by almost 50 percent between the United States and most
countries on the European continent.

42. A former resident of Canton, Ohio, was trying to
describe her image of the city to her classmates. She
found they had no image of this mid-sized city. She
described Canton as a city with major manufacturing
facilities and a downtown revitalization program.
(A) That fact suddenly crystallized the concept of Canton.
If Canton is destroyed, the nation might fall. That’s an
image that gave meaning and fullness to what it meant
to live in Canton.
(B) Her explanation moved the city from the position of no
image to that of a negative image. The class concluded
that Canton is a typical, boring, industrialized city.
(C) Then she suddenly recalled an experience: “I remember
hearing from a teacher that during World War II Canton
was a major U.S. target of the Germans.” Imagine, right
after the cities of Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles,
appears the name of Canton.

have been told ― it requires us to investigate the
past. Like a detective, we start with the easy, known
pieces of information.
(A) You have to go further to ask questions such as, “Why
was he cruel?” and “What were the results of his rule?”
Hence, studying history trains us not to accept everything
we read or hear as the truth. Instead, it trains us to use our
critical thinking skills to get the full picture of the past.
(B) For example, if someone told you that Chinese Emperor
Qin Shihuang was a cruel ruler, would you simply accept
this as the truth? Or, would you ask questions about the
statement and look for information or evidence to support it?
(C) We then shuffle the pieces around to see how they fit
together. Once all the pieces fit, we have the full picture.
As we put the pieces together, we challenge ourselves
to think of other ways to describe what we know.

While there are many places where this traditional view

with glassware and sophisticated equipment. ( (1) ) The
person doing the science is wearing a white lab coat and
probably looks rather serious while engaged in some type of
experiment. ( (2) ) Science can also be found at a construction
site, on a basketball court, and at a concert. ( (3) ) The truth
is that science is happening all around us. ( (4) ) It’s at work

Many of us believe that amnesia, or sudden memory
loss, results in the inability to recall one’s name and
identity. This belief may reflect the way amnesia is
usually portrayed in movies, television, and literature. For
example, when we meet Matt Damon’s character in the
movie The Bourne Identity, we learn that he has no
memory for who he is, why he has the skills he does, or
where he is from. He spends much of the movie trying
to answer these questions. However, the inability to
remember your name and identity is exceedingly rare in
reality. Amnesia most often results from a brain injury
that leaves the victim unable to form new memories, but
with most memories of the past intact.

While media often depict amnesia as a failure to (A)
past memories, especially one’s identity, most cases of
amnesia actually leave the sufferers unable to (B)
new memories with most memories of the past undamaged.

Our romantic mistakes can always be undone these days,
which you would think is a good thing. But the very
reversibility of our romantic commitments has only
worsened our problem because that also undermines our
satisfaction with our choices. To see this, you only need to
look at a study of a group of college students in a
photography class. The students made a print of their two
best photographs. They were then told that they could choose
one of the photos but that the other would be kept on file
as an example of their work. Then, the teacher added a twist.
One group was told that their choice was final. Whatever
they chose, they could not change their minds later. The other
group was told that they could switch photographs if they
changed their minds. In a survey taken later, students who
were allowed to change their mind liked their photos less
than the other students.
Why this paradoxical result? According to one researcher,
the brain has a kind of built-in defense system that works
to make us choices that cannot be undone.
Despite thinking that we would like the freedom to change
our minds, it appears that we are happier with our choices
if we think they can’t be changed, which means we would
be better off if we made romantic commitments more
permanent and more difficult to break, rather than less.

(A)
Maureen Ferris was my best friend and I sometimes
visited her house after school. Her mother was stern and
meticulous about house cleaning. My mother, on the other
hand, did not care as much about a messy house. She had
sauce stains on her apron and sometimes allowed the
laundry to pile up. In the midst of her chores, my mother
spent time reading. This was her time away from endless
hours of child care and housework. Unironed school blouses
and a dirty kitchen might make (a) her feel guilty, but her
reading never did.
(B)
I carried over the love of reading to my workplace as
well. Off I’d go to work each day, passing on the gift of
reading to my students. I’d watch as they discovered they
could read and make sense of the letters and the words on
a page. All over the world there was agreement that this was
important, as important as eating or thinking or working.
And then one day, I finally understood what (b) she had
tried to show us, that reading was housework of the very
best kind.
(C)
One day, as I played in Maureen’s clean house, her mom
fixed me with (c) her cool gray eyes and said, “Your
mother’s nice, but she reads too much.” I was stunned. The
next time I caught my mother reading in her little patch of
sunlight, I studied (d) her in the doorway and decided her
apron could use a washing. Shame flushed through me.
Reading was the cause ― pleasure-reading in broad daylight.
Silently, I made vows that would keep me from sharing my
mother’s fate.
(D)
I tried my best not to follow in (e) her footsteps, but I
didn’t know that it was already too late for me. The way
I treasured my books revealed the extent of how much I
was already like my mother. The years passed in a blur of
covertly turned pages until I was a grown-up schoolteacher
with a husband and children of my own. I struggled
mightily with my own desire to open a novel in brazen
daylight. My only guiltless reading occurred at night, when
the dishes were rattling in the dishwasher and the kids
were in bed.

to do it from her own mother. Then Langer asked her
grandmother. She explained that when she was a young
mother, the only roasting pan (4) she’d had was too short
for a standard roast, so she had to cut off the end to fit
it into the pan. She’d long since gotten roasting pans in
larger sizes and hadn’t cut an end off since. Yet for
years both Langer and (5) her mother had mindlessly
followed this routine.

We take it for granted that film directors are in the
game of recycling. Adapting novels (1) is one of the most
respectable of movie projects, while a book that calls
itself the novelization of a film is considered barbarous.
Being a hybrid art as well as a late one, film has always
been in a dialogue with (2) other narrative genres. Movies
were first seen as an exceptionally potent kind of illusionist
theatre, the rectangle of the screen corresponding to the
proscenium of a stage, (3) which appear actors. Starting in
the early silent period, plays were regularly “turned into”
films. But (4) filming plays did not encourage the evolution
of what truly was distinctive about a movie: the intervention
of the camera ― its mobility of vision. As a source of plot,
character, and dialogue, the novel seemed more (5) suitable.
Many early successes of cinema were adaptations of

of great plans to find success in this unknown land. I
had accepted a job offer from Dr. Gilbert, who had
opened a medical clinic at an inland village last year. It
gave me great pleasure to think about how my dream
would become a reality. I looked again at the coast. The
line of distant mountains and shapes of houses were
gradually emerging through the mist. They welcomed me
with endless promises.

23. To say that we need to curb anger and our negative
thoughts and emotions does not mean that we should deny
our feelings. There is an important distinction to be made
between denial and restraint. The latter constitutes a
deliberate and voluntarily adopted discipline based on an
appreciation of the benefits of doing so. This is very
different from the case of someone who suppresses
emotions such as anger out of a feeling that they need to
present a facade of self-control, or out of fear of what
others may think. Such behaviour is like closing a wound
which is still infected. We are not talking about
rule-following. Where denial and suppression occur, there
comes the danger that in doing so the individual

that at some future point they may find they cannot
contain these feelings any longer.

24. Have you ever heard anyone say of a dog, “Well, he’s
very successful and lives in a beautiful house, but he’s
not very happy”? One reason most dogs are much happier
than most people is that dogs aren’t affected by external
circumstances the way we are. I notice that even when it’s
pouring rain outside, my dogs, Blue and Celeste, are still
excited to go for a walk. As soon as I open the front door
to look outside, they’re beside me in a flash, standing
expectantly, ready for an adventure. I usually wait for a
break in the downpour, and then we all dash out together.

puddles dotting the landscape .
While I’m carefully picking my way around the wet

25. In Belding’s ground squirrels, males leave home and
females mature in their natal area. This male-biased dispersal
creates an imbalance in the way males and females are
related to those individuals around them ― females find
themselves surrounded by relatives, while males are generally
in areas with complete strangers. This asymmetry translates
into females who warn close kin by emitting alarm calls,
while males generally do not emit calls since their dispersal
from their natal areas means their blood kin typically do
not benefit from such a warning. Further support for the
kinship-based alarm-calling hypothesis includes Sherman’s
finding that in the rare instances when females do move
away from their natal groups and into groups with far fewer
relatives, they .
(1) end up acquiring the alarm calls of the new group
(2) make constant attempts to bring their blood kin along
(3) display a tendency to become more active and cooperative
(4) emit alarm calls less frequently than do native females
(5) adopt a more elaborate defense mechanism than alarm
calls
26. By likening the eye to a camera, elementary biology
textbooks help to produce a misleading impression of
what perception entails. Only in terms of the physics of
image formation do the eye and camera have anything in
common. Both eye and camera have a lens that focuses
light rays from the outside world into an image, and both
have a means of adjusting the focus and brightness of
that image. Both eye and camera have a light-sensitive
layer onto which the image is cast (the retina and film,
respectively). However, image formation is only the first
step towards seeing.

the two, which is that the camera merely records an

27. Recent evidence suggests that the common ancestor of
Neanderthals and modern people, living about 400,000
years ago, may have already been using pretty sophisticated
language. If language is based on genes and is the key to
cultural evolution, and Neanderthals had language, then
why did the Neanderthal toolkit show so little cultural
change? Moreover, genes would undoubtedly have changed
during the human revolution after 200,000 years ago, but
more in response to new habits than as causes of them. At
an earlier date, cooking selected mutations for smaller guts
and mouths, rather than vice versa. At a later date, milk
drinking selected for mutations for retaining lactose digestion
into adulthood in people of western European and East
African descent. .
The appeal to a genetic change driving evolution gets

explanation for a bottom-up process. [3점]

28. To describe what happens to common resources as a
result of human greed, Garrett Hardin used the example
of an area of pasture on which all the cattle-owners are
permitted to graze their animals free of charge. Each
cattle-owner seeks to (A) his gain and in doing so
considers the relative advantage and disadvantage of
adding one more animal to the herd. The advantage is
that the cattle-owner receives the whole of the profit
from the sale of the additional animal. The disadvantage
is that the extra grazing contributes to the deterioration of
the pasture. However, the disadvantage is shared among
all the cattle-owners using the pasture, so the individual
owner suffers only a fraction of the disadvantage.
Consequently, the advantage is bound to (B) the
disadvantage. Thus, it is inevitable that more and more
animals will be brought onto the pasture until overgrazing
totally destroys the pasture.

describe and predict the data we observe about the
universe. Newton’s theory of gravity is one example;
Einstein’s theory of gravity is another. Those theories,
though they describe the same phenomenon, constitute
very different versions of reality. Newton, (A) ,
imagined that masses affect each other by exerting a
force, while in Einstein’s theory the effects occur through
a bending of space and time and there is no concept of
gravity as a force. Either theory could be employed to
describe, with great accuracy, the falling of an apple, but
Newton’s would be much easier to use. (B) , for

Gregorio Dati was a successful merchant of Florence,
who entered into many profitable partnerships dealing in
wool, silk, and other merchandise. His career, however,
especially early on, knew the vicissitudes characteristic of
Renaissance business. For example, while he was en
route to Spain as his enterprise’s traveling partner, a role
typical for young men, pirates robbed him of all his
goods, including a consignment of pearls, and of his own
clothes. His recovery from such losses followed in part
from four successive marriages. Later in life, he was
honored to serve a number of posts in the city
government. Over the years he wrote a “diary,” actually
an occasional record in which he kept accounts of his
commercial and family life. Men of his kind pioneered
this form of writing about the public and private self.

The Great Salt Lake is the largest salt lake in the
Western Hemisphere. The lake is fed by the Bear, Weber,
and Jordan rivers and has no outlet. At the close of the
Ice Age the entire region was submerged beneath a lake
of meltwater, and overflow from the lake flowed into the
Pacific Ocean through the Snake and Columbia rivers. The
great climatic change the lake underwent and continued
evaporation, exceeding the inflow of fresh water, reduced
the lake to one-twentieth of its former size. The majority
of salt in the Great Salt Lake is a remnant of dissolved
salts that are present in all fresh water. As the water
evaporated, the traces of dissolved salts were gradually
concentrated in the shrinking lake.

activity while an adult is watching, according to recent
studies, they are less likely to continue the activity when
the adult leaves or to repeat the activity in the future.
Rather than increasing children’s commitment to positive
behavior, praise encourages children to find ways to get
future verbal “goodies” from important adults. In other
words, praise is like the large pink icing rose in the center
of a cake. It is appealing and at first bite its sweetness
tastes wonderful. A couple more bites still might taste
good, but it quickly becomes overly sweet. It has only

37. Why is it difficult to find a runner who competes
equally well in both 100-m and 10,000-m races? The
primary reason is that our muscles contain two main
types of muscle fibers, called slow and fast muscle fibers.
Slow muscle fibers are muscle cells that can sustain
repeated contractions but don’t generate a lot of quick
power for the body. They perform better in endurance
exercises, like long-distance running, which require slow,
steady muscle activity. Fast muscle fibers are cells that
can contract more quickly and powerfully than slow
muscle fibers but fatigue much more easily; they function
best for short bursts of intense activity, like weight lifting
or sprinting.
(1) reasons for runners to develop strong muscles
(2) differences between slow and fast muscle fibers
(3) comparison of sprinting with long-distance running
(4) necessity of building muscles for long-distance runners
(5) relationship between muscle fibers and physical fatigue

experiments. A bias occurs when what the scientist expects
changes how the results are viewed. This expectation might
cause a scientist to select a result from one trial over those
from other trials. Scientists can lessen bias by running as

each observation made. Valid experiments also must have
data that are measurable. This allows others to compare
the results to data they obtain from a similar experiment.
Most importantly, the experiment must be repeatable.

emissions from energy, and it did seem to encourage
environmental innovation. However, unexpected circumstances
came when they tried to apply this approach globally.
Agreeing on international taxes on emissions was

Union has experienced terrible difficulties in trying to
regularize the complex and myriad differences in its
members’ sales taxes. Besides, although Sweden, Finland,
and Denmark barely decided to introduce carbon taxes
during the 1990s, they have not harmonized their

Apologies often fail. One reason apologies fail is that
the “offender” and the “victim” usually see the event
differently. Examining personal narratives, researchers
have found that those who cause harm tend to minimize
the offense ― probably to protect themselves from shame
and guilt. They also tend to downplay the consequences of
their actions. (1) These tendencies can inflame the anger
of the hurt person, who, in contrast, may see an offense
as bigger than it really is. (2) When sincere apologies are
offered in an ordinary human relationship, they are
readily accepted by the victims and reconciliations ensue.
(3) Those who are hurt tend to see the act as one with
severe consequences and as part of an ongoing pattern
that is inexcusable and immoral. (4) Each person has his
or her own truth, and there is distortion on both sides.
(5) Therefore, to apologize sincerely we must first listen
attentively to how the other person really feels about
what happened ― not simply assert what we think
happened.

Once upon a time, there was only one way to launch a

“Why, in country after country that mandated seat
belts, was it impossible to see the promised reduction in
road accident fatalities?” John Adams, professor of
geography at University College London, wrote in one
of his many essays on risk. “It appears that measures
that protect drivers from the consequences of bad
driving encourage bad driving. The principal effect of
seat belt legislation has been a shift in the burden of
risk from those already best protected in cars, to the
most vulnerable, pedestrians and cyclists, outside cars.”
Adams started to group these counterintuitive findings
under the concept of risk compensation, the idea that
humans have an inborn tolerance for risk. As safety
features are added to vehicles and roads, drivers feel
less vulnerable and tend to take more chances. The
phenomenon can be observed in all aspects of our daily
lives. Children who wear protective gear during their
games have a tendency to take more physical risks.
Hikers take more risks when they think a rescuer can

What should writers do when they’re teased by
intriguing but elusive ideas, by hints of thoughts that
seem too vague to be expressed in words? Edgar Allan
Poe’s advice is simple: They should pick up their pens
(or, he might add today, power up their laptops). Poe
dismisses the argument that any ideas are so deep or
subtle that they’re “ .”
“For my own part,” he said in an 1846 article in
Graham’s Magazine, “I have never had a thought which
I could not set down in words, with even more
distinctness than that with which I conceived it.” The
“mere act” of writing, Poe believed, helps writers make
their ideas not only clearer but more logical. To use his
phrase, the process of writing contributes to “the
logicalization of thought.”
Whenever he felt dissatisfied with a vague “conception
of the brain,” Poe said, “I resort forthwith to the pen,
for the purpose of obtaining, through its aid, the
necessary form, consequence and precision.”
Today’s advocates of freewriting would probably agree
with Poe on this point. Sometimes, the best way to
resolve a dilemma ― whether it’s a writing dilemma or
a thinking dilemma ― is simply to start writing.

On May 29th there was a heavy rain but the sun came
out the next day. Driving back from the village, I stopped
the car because a small woodchuck was traveling
along the road, its belly almost flat to the gravel. I got
out, took off my sweater, threw it over the woodchuck and
wrapped him in it, then put him on the floor of the car
while I drove home. I guessed the rain had washed out his
burrow. If I hadn’t come along (a) he would have eventually
died of starvation. Rescuing him, I felt as large as Fate.

Very shortly the carton seemed too small. I offered
him a nest made of a covered box, bedded with straw
and with a round doorway cut in the front. He knew
instantly that a hole spells home, and (b) he dashed
inside. Every time I came to feed him, he jumped into
my lap as eagerly as ever. As the months passed, the
chuck grew bigger and bigger. My husband remarked
that if I didn’t do something soon, I would be chased
around for the rest of my days by a 15-pound
woodchuck begging for milk.
(C)
At home I put him in the bathtub and my husband
found a large carton. (c) He put cat litter in the bottom
and straw on top of that. When I put the chuck in, he
gratefully burrowed into the straw. I made a mixture of
milk and baby cereal for him. When I gave it to the
chuck, he ate it greedily. (d) He accepted me quickly. If
I put my hand in the carton, he nibbled my fingers. It
became clear that I was imprinting the woodchuck and
vice versa.
* imprint: 강하게 인상지우다
(D)
I decided to put him in a new burrow. I found a hole
along the wall of our orchard, put the chuck near it and
left him. I continued to visit him with his milk. Each
time (e) he greeted me joyfully, drank greedily, and tried
persistently to follow me back into the house. The
parting came unexpectedly. I went away on a brief trip.

the grass, I will hope that it is he.
