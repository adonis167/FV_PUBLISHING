18. 밑줄 친 This가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
You experience displeasure while using various types of products or services. You think determining liability for your displeasure is difficult and the amount of monetary loss is small. You also don’t know where to go to handle the displeasure and where to receive compensation. However, you are eager to deal with these situations. This is where you can get help. It provides you with counseling and handles your complaints related to various fields such as automobiles, housing and facilities, publications, services, finance and insurance, law, and medicine. This also demands payment for you from a corporation based on the Compensation Criteria for Consumers’ Damages.

Tom and his colleague, Sue, were attending a conference for music teachers in New York. While at the conference ①he purchased a talking metronome, a device for counting the beats in a song. Before Tom and Sue boarded their flight home, Tom put his carry­on bag on the security­check conveyor belt. The security guard’s eyes widened as ②he watched the monitor. He asked Tom what ③he had in the bag. Then the guard slowly pulled out of the bag the device covered with dials and switches. “It’s a talking metronome,” Tom insisted. “Look, I’ll show you.” ④He took the box and flipped a switch. “One, two, three,……” said the metronome in perfect time. The guard breathed a sigh of relief. Sue whispered to Tom as ⑤he gathered his belongings, “Aren’t you glad it didn’t go ‘Three, two, one,……’?”
20. 다음 글의 목적으로 가장 적절한 것은?
I feel a little overwhelmed now by all the “new” in my life. New job. New apartment. New neighborhood. But the best “new” is a new perspective. I don’t have to tell you how desperate I was feeling. When things started to go from bad to worse, I almost felt numb. That is, until you came on the scene. I just can’t thank you enough for all the time you’ve spent with me. Calling everyone in your network to help me locate a new job here. Coaching me on the interview. The hours you’ve spent on my behalf seem like an incredible gift. Your love and concern feel like a warm blanket on those long nights as I adjust to my new life.

If properly stored, broccoli will stay fresh for up to four days. The best way to store fresh bunches (A)is / are to refrigerate them in an open plastic bag in the vegetable compartment, which will give them the right balance of humidity and air, and help preserve the vitamin C content. Don’t wash the broccoli before storing it since moisture on its surface (B)encourages / to encourage the growth of mold. However, like most vegetables, it is at its best condition when used within a day or two after the purchase. Preparing broccoli is extremely easy, so all you have to do is boil it in water just until it (C)is / will be tender, three to five minutes.

22. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
In business settings, it’s really easy to forget ①to take the time to say Thank­You, and yet, it’s an essential part of interaction with others. It’s important to people that they feel valid, important, and ②respected. Just as saying sorry matters, so does ③remember to thank those who help you move forward. And I think it’s much nicer to send along a physical card than an email. A personal note written by your own hand matters ④far more than a few lines of typing into a window that’s so easily available at your fingertips. One more thing: if you’re going to go this route, put in the extra few minutes to purchase a nice card and ⑤use a pen that gives you a decent flow.
23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Ending your shower with cold water can be good for your health. ①Warm water makes the blood rush to your skin, and cool water makes the blood rush to your organs. ②This switching between hot and cold triggers better circulation by forcing the blood to move. ③The ideal practice would be to switch numerous times between hot and cold water, but merely ending the shower with cold water does help with circulation. ④Taking frequent showers in fact can cause skin problems and other infections. ⑤Good circulation improves the performance of your system and thus makes you look and feel better. 



[24～27] 다음 글의 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 
24. One of the most important aspects of green products should be           . If something is tough or can be readily repaired, this lessens the chance that it’ll end up in the landfill, and could easily save you money in the long run, even if it’s initially more expensive. Even recyclable materials, if they break and can’t be fixed, require energy and other resources to reprocess and then replace. Long­lasting goods can be passed on from person to person. Even if your style changes and that kitchen table isn’t your thing anymore, a good strong table will almost always be appealing to someone else, while a broken and unfixable one probably won’t.
① uniqueness	② cleanliness	③ mobility	
④ durability	⑤ beauty


25. A new study suggests that kids might be at increased risk of getting the disease of the lungs depending on                                         . Looking at more than 95,000 infants born from 1995 to 2000, researchers followed the children through 2005. What they found was those born in the autumn were nearly 30% more likely to get asthma. The researchers say it’s because babies born in the fall months are much more likely to get common wintertime infections. At birth, infants have protection against certain diseases because antibodies have passed from the mother to her unborn baby. But the protection is temporary. So, as their immunities fade, babies become more subject to infections, especially in the winter months when all kinds of germs are swirling through the air.                        *asthma 천식
① where they live
② when they were born
③ what sports they like
④ what they usually eat
⑤ how healthy their parents are
26. El Sistema, which is known as one of the most successful social inclusion projects, is a national network of youth orchestras and music centers in Venezuela. About three decades ago, José Antonio Abreu developed the idea of　　　　　　　　　　                               　 , in order to offer children from poor neighborhoods an alternative to life on the streets. In the dangerous and poverty‐stricken slums of Caracas, Abreu lifted children out of despair through music, changing both people and the system of the society. In 1975 he established the first Venezuelan youth orchestra with 12 children. Since then he has built up a network of orchestras and music centers through the whole country. Currently 250,000 children and young adults are playing a musical instrument, and by 2012 these numbers will have doubled. 
① building libraries for the public
② combining social work with music
③ founding a food relief organization
④ developing vocational education policies
⑤ organizing an international movie festival

27. Much is now known about natural hazards and the negative impacts they have on people and their property. It would seem obvious that any logical person would avoid such potential impacts or at least modify their behavior or their property to minimize such impacts. However,                                                              . Until someone has a personal experience or knows someone who has such an experience, most people subconsciously believe “It won’t happen here” or “It won’t happen to me.” Even knowledgeable scientists who are aware of the hazards, the odds of their occurrence, and the costs of an event do not always act appropriately. [3점]
① humans are not always rational
② people can overcome natural disasters
③ experience can sometimes cause prejudice
④ every human doesn’t experience misfortune
⑤ scientists know the solutions to natural hazards 

28. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 문맥에 맞는 낱말로 가장 적절한 것은?
Can you identify others’ personality from colors they like? Some psychologists actually use personality tests based on color (A)conference / preference. These color psychologists have generally thought that outgoing, adventurous, and competitive people like bold, bright colors. Conversely, people who like softer tones are more likely to exhibit a quieter, gentler nature. While there is some truth in such (B)assumptions / exceptions, you should remember that people from various backgrounds and experiences will be attracted to certain colors and be offended by others. Therefore, color psychology, although interesting, provides only broad (C)regulations / generalizations in analyzing personality types.
      (A)               (B)               (C)
① conference   …   assumptions   …   regulations
② conference   …   exceptions    …   regulations
③ conference   …   exceptions    …   generalizations
④ preference   …   assumptions   …   generalizations
⑤ preference   …   exceptions     …   generalizations

29. 다음 그림에 대한 글의 내용 중, 밑줄 친 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은 것은?

Years ago I saw a woman showing her magic powers. She filled a glass with water, then ①covered it with her handkerchief, previously dipped in water. She pushed down the center of the cloth, ②inverted the glass on her right palm, then seized it with her left hand. Air pressure ballooned the cloth ③upward inside the glass. “When I put my finger on the glass,” she explained, “it will make the water boil.” When she did so, bubbles began ④rising. You could even hear the surface bubbling! What happened was this. When she pushed with her finger, the glass slipped downward through her left hand, causing the handkerchief to slide upward on the outside. This ⑤raised the center of the cloth inside, forming a vacuum. The vacuum drew air through the handkerchief and created an illusion of boiling water.

30. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
It is said that a cozy hat is a must on a cold winter’s day. We are often led to believe that most of our body heat is lost through our heads. Closer inspection of heat loss in the hatless,     (A)    , reveals that is nonsense. The myth has arisen through a flawed interpretation of an experiment in the 1950s. In the study, volunteers were dressed in Arctic survival suits and exposed to bitterly cold conditions. Because the head was the only part of their bodies left uncovered, most of their heat was lost through their heads.    (B)   , covering one part of the body has as much effect as covering any other. If the experiment had been performed with people wearing only swimming trunks, they would have lost no more than 10% of their body heat through their heads.
       (A)                   (B)
① therefore	    ……     In fact
② therefore     ……     Similarly
③ for example   ……     Similarly
④ however      ……     In fact
⑤ however      ……     For example
31. 다음 글에 드러난 필자의 심정으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
When I moved into a two‐bedroom flat with Ally, I thought we could get on well. Initially, everything seemed fine. Then, as the weeks passed, things began to change. When I went out, she’d sneak into my room and read my journal. She would put on my clothes and cosmetics without my permission. Once, she took off all the framed photos of mine, which were very important to me, and hung a large frame of abstract painting instead. It was the last straw, however, when she started spreading rumors; she told my friends that I got addicted to computer games, which wasn’t true. When I confronted her, she denied it. But I couldn’t stand her any more.
① safe and relieved	② upset and annoyed
③ bored and indifferent	④ pleased and grateful
⑤ excited and anticipating


[32～33] 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 
32. Trust is the basis of all transactions. It’s the basis of the economy. World Bank economist Stephen Knack has long studied the economics of trust. According to him, the huge disparity in income between the United States and Somalia can be explained entirely as a disparity in trust. Put differently, the income enjoyed by the American people is 0.5 percent the result of hard work and 99.5 percent the result of trust. While that sounds extreme, there’s something to it if you consider how market transactions and business activities are impossible without it. Without adequate trust, the cost of transactions rises and there are even times when mutually beneficial transactions cannot be realized.

② 신용거래의 잠재적 위험성
③ 국가 간 빈부 격차의 심화
④ 정치가 경제에 미치는 영향
⑤ 경제 활동에서 신뢰의 중요성


33. We think of butterfly wings as being colorful, but many are relatively drab on the underside. Some butterflies protect themselves through camouflage－by folding up their wings, they reveal the undersides and blend in with their surroundings. Through this strategy, they become nearly invisible to predators. Some other butterflies are brightly and distinctively colored, but they taste nasty. A bird that eats one of these butterflies remembers the experience－and avoids repeating it. Now other species of butterfly that do not taste nasty mimic the nasty ones. They are born looking like them in color and shape but not taste. Birds and lizards, who have learned to avoid bold warning coloration, leave these imitators alone.                     *drab 칙칙한 갈색의
① why butterflies travel long distances
② how butterflies find their food
③ how butterflies fool their predators
④ why birds and lizards like butterflies
⑤ why butterflies don’t have nests

34. 다음 글의 주장으로 가장 적절한 것은?
These days, lots of young people are worried about their future because of the economic recession. More seriously, even experts can’t predict what’s going to happen in the near future. They just say the financial crisis won’t be solved easily unlike the past. So, most young people, including recent graduates, have difficulty in getting jobs. Then, is there no way out? They should change direction! It’s time  for them to turn their eyes to the other side of the world. They don’t necessarily have to realize their dreams home. Instead, they need to change their stage to perform on for their future. Of course, there are risks involved. However, they can’t move forward if they are afraid of the risks.

35. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는 문장은?

The graph above shows Americans’ ratings of their life today compared with their life five years ago. ①The percentage of people who said their life was better off was always higher than that of those who responded negatively. ②Especially, between 1994 and 2002, more than half the respondents answered they were better off than five years ago. ③In 1990, the percentage of those who answered positively was nearly twice as high as that of those who answered negatively. ④From 1990 to 1996, the gap between the rates of the two groups increased steadily. In 1996, the highest percentage of people had the positive view of their life. ⑤However, the year 2008 showed that about two-thirds of the respondents had the negative view of their life.
36. FTF에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The FTF is a trade association that promotes fair trade. The FTF traces its roots to the late 1970s when many individual trade organizations began holding yearly conferences on fair trade. In 1994, they incorporated formally as the NAATO and, the following year, changed its name to the FTF. It envisions a just and sustainable global economic system in which purchasing and production choices are made with concern for the well­being of people and the environment. It seeks to reduce poverty by continually and significantly expanding the practice of trade that values the labor and dignity of all people.

⑤ 인력 감축을 통한 비용 절감을 추구한다.


37. snowy plover에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The snowy plover is one of the hardest birds to spot on the beach. Once numbering in the thousands, the species is listed as endangered in several states now. Beige and white, snowy plovers blend perfectly in the white sand. They eat tiny flies that live on the sand or mud flats. Their nests usually contain three tiny eggs, which look like sand and are barely visible to even the most well­trained eye. Mothers incubate the nests during the day and fathers at night. Chicks can get out of their nest within three hours of hatching. They walk, run, and swim well but still require their parents’ care after hatching.

[38～39] 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
38. Did I remember to turn the stove off? Did I remember to lock the front door? I’d better look again. We all feel the need to check again sometimes, to reassure ourselves that we didn’t neglect a possibly dangerous problem. But for some people, checking can consume hours every day, driven by intense fears of unlikely scenarios. A teacher continually searches the floor, obsessed with the idea that a dropped needle might injure her students. A man spends an hour every morning verifying that all the doors and windows are shut before he leaves for work. Yet this habit of checking doesn’t solve the worry at all, doubt still grows, and if it gets worse, it can lead to medical treatment.
① Care killed the cat.
② Every dog has his day.
③ Opportunity only knocks once.
④ Two’s company, three’s a crowd.
⑤ One man’s music is another man’s noise.







39. The saying, “To err is human, to forgive, divine,” shows the ideal we should have: people should be forgiving of other’s mistakes. To err or to make mistakes is indeed a part of being human but it seems that most people don’t want to accept the responsibility for having made a mistake. Rather, they are likely to do the opposite-to find someone else to shift the blame to. They naturally look for someone else who could be responsible for the problem. So the twisted version of the saying “To err is human. To blame the other guy is more human.” is meant to be a joke and yet it gives us more information about human nature.

③ 인간은 죄의식에서 벗어나려고 신에게 의지한다.
④ 인간은 의지가 약하기 때문에 실수를 하게 된다.
⑤ 인간은 끊임없는 선택을 하며 살아간다.

A group of scientists has devised a procedure for locating infections without surgery.  

(A)The white blood cells are injected back into the body, and a special camera is used to pick up signals from the indium­Ⅲ. Since white blood cells fight infection, they will travel to the infected area, producing a signal from the region.
(B)They take a blood sample from a patient, and they isolate the white blood cells and mix them with a radioactive element, indium­Ⅲ.
(C)The location of the signal discloses to the doctor where the infection is and how critical it is. The doctor can then select a treatment without hesitation.

[41～42] 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 
41.Organizations like the National Audubon Society once encouraged interest in birds, and bird watching became a popular pastime and a favorite way to spend leisure time. Unfortunately, the growth of interest has affected the birds themselves. One rare bird can bring a flock of bird watchers. Both vegetation and nesting places have been trampled by feet of overenthusiastic bird watchers. Birds are naturally shy; the presence of too many people can cause them to abandon a nest and eggs in it. For example, a black hawk was so upset by the people gathering to see it return to its nest that it laid only one egg in its nest in five years.          *trample 짓밟다
① Shyness: Nature of Rare Birds
② Qualities of Good Bird Watchers
③ Bird Watching: Real Harm to Birds
④ More Attention to Bird Migration
⑤ Tips for Keeping Birds as Pets

42.There is plenty of evidence that second­hand smoke-breathed when you are in the same room as someone smoking-can be harmful, particularly to children, and some parents adopt a strategy of never smoking in their child’s presence. According to a researcher, however, this would not offer complete protection because there can be third­hand smoke. Toxic particles in cigarette smoke can remain on nearby surfaces, as well as the hair and clothing of the smoker, long after the cigarette has been put out, and small children are easily influenced because they are likely to breathe in close proximity, or even lick and suck them. Therefore, it is vital that people are made aware of the possible risks associated with smoking on the health of children.         *proximity 근접
① Don’t Smoke Your Life Away
② Air Pollution Caused by Smoking
③ Warning over Third­hand Smoke
④ Dangers of Breathing in Toxic Air
⑤ The Increase of Non­smoking Areas

43. 다음 글의 상황에 나타난 분위기로 가장 적절한 것은?
It was dark outside, and rain fell in icy torrents. Inside, the three children sat around their grandfather, the only light in the room coming from an old lantern that sat on the rough, wooden table. The children were captivated by his every word as his low voice poured out tales of pirates, treasure and the sea. They were certain they could hear the sound of the rough wind hurling the surf against the rocks. Though it was cold and wet outside in their imaginations, inside it was warm and dry, and one by one the children’s eyes began to close. With gentle hands, the grandfather carried them up to their beds and tucked them in.
① sad and gloomy	② busy and festive
③ messy and noisy	④ tense and urgent

The study also suggests that luck is a matter of interpretation.

Successful people often say that “you make your own luck,” and the results from a study suggest that this is true. (①) If people believe that they are lucky, then they are more likely to continue trying until they succeed at something. ( ② ) Those who think they are unlucky, on the other hand, do the opposite. (③) They rarely try something new because they “know” they will not win, and therefore they can never succeed. (④) When one of the subjects fell down the stairs and broke his arm, he did not think that this was unlucky.

Today, the common store of information and knowledge is more complex and more accessible. The accessibility of them through the Internet is now much more the domain of the young, the masters of the new cybernetic world. However, wisdom’s domain lies in another direction. Wisdom is not exclusively about information and knowledge, but about “context,” and in this arena the young must often still yield to the old. Why? Because when it comes to the essentials of living, it is clear we haven’t made as much progress since ancient times. Wisdom moves slowly because it takes a lifetime to acquire. In fact, it is the paradox of wisdom, that the faster we try to master it, the slower it comes to us. Wisdom mostly remains the domain of the elders, and the technology revolution has not diminished our need for them.

[46～48] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)It was December 1972. I had been head football coach at Pennsylvania State University for almost seven years. Then that unexpected phone call had come. The man on the phone was Bill Sullivan, principal owner of the New England Patriots. “I want to meet with you to talk about coaching my team,” he said. (a)He hit me with his package-$1.3 million, plus part ownership of the franchise. 
(B) From the moment of that nighttime revelation, I knew what college football means to me-and what pro football never could mean. I love winning games as much as any coach does, but I know there’s something that counts more than victory or defeat. (b)I get to watch my players grow-in their personal discipline, in their educational development, and as human beings. That is a deep, lasting reward that I could never get in pro ball.
(C)I pretended I was asleep. I lay there thinking about the life I was leaving. I saw the school where I had met my wife and got married, the only home our five kids had ever known. I saw my thick­necked, fragile­hearted football players. What had made me tell Sullivan I’d come? (c)Yes, Boston was a great city and it was a new challenge. But it was ... the money. Suddenly I knew what it was I had to do, what it was I wanted to do. In the morning, I told Sue, “You went to bed with a millionaire, but you woke up with me. I’m not going.” 
(D)(d)Sullivan’s offer made me dizzy. In the end, I told my wife, “I have to take the job.” “Joe, whatever you want to do will be fine with me,” Sue replied. (e)I called Sullivan and told him we had a deal. When Sue and I went to bed that evening, I was pleased. At 2:00 a.m., Sue was sitting in her rocking chair nursing our baby. I’m sure she thought I was asleep. She had never said she didn’t want to go to Boston. But now tears were slipping down her face.

There is a famous psychology experiment to help us understand how opinions and judgements can be formed. The general experiment procedure was devised by Dr. Asch in the U.S. What happens is this: A volunteer is asked to join a group for the study of the discrimination of length. And he goes to a room where a number of people and the experimenter are seated. The volunteer doesn’t know that the other people in the room are researchers working together with the experimenter. A pair of cards is introduced. On one of them there is a line and on the other, three lines. Of these three, one is clearly longer than the line on the other card, one is shorter and one the same length. Seeing the cards, everyone is in turn asked which of the three lines on the second card is equal to the line on the first. They all pick-as they have been told to pick-the wrong line. Last of all, comes the turn of our volunteer. In many cases the volunteer, faced with the opinion of the group, denies the plain evidence of his senses and picks the same one as others do. This experiment shows even the sane and ordinary people could be made to deny the obvious facts, feeling the pressure to        . The people around you, “the pressure group” can have a great influence on your judgement and decisions.

This started as early as 8000 B.C. During the New Stone Age as people began to settle into fixed agricultural communities, this intensified. Originally raised mainly for their meat, sheep and goats became valuable also for their milk and wool. Cattle were domesticated both for meat and skin and as work animals for agriculture. Their milk production was not a factor until much later in history when breeding for high milk production produced suitable cows. Horses were also domesticated and became important for transportation and came to play a major part in warfare.

We push down our feelings because most of us have been brought up to believe that there are feelings which are unacceptable. Some of us learned that all emotions are unacceptable, while others learned that specific emotions such as anger or crying are unacceptable. In fact, there is absolutely nothing wrong with any kind of feeling. When someone tells you not to feel sad or angry, he or she is asking the impossible. You can deny the feelings you are having but you cannot stop them from coming. All that feelings need, in order to pass, is to be acknowledged and accepted. Just saying to yourself, or someone else, 'I feel angry' (or sad, or frightened) is a great start. Let yourself _________ the feelings, good or bad.

Human beings direct their activities toward the satisfaction of physical wants and general well-being. They avoid, whenever possible, situations that may bring about physical deprivation, including pain, hunger, and a need for sleep. Much contemporary advertising promises these satisfactions, whether from headache remedies, fancy foods, or form-fitting mattresses. An individual can suffer any of these deprivations temporarily, however, and he may knowingly enter into situations which will deprive him for a time if he believes that there will be _________________.

No matter how we shake or tap the bottle of ketchup, some of it refuses to come out. In some cases, up to 20 percent of the product is left in the packaging when it is thrown out. This is not only annoying for consumers but also poses difficulties when recycling: The leftovers first have to be removed from the packaging, which is expensive, time-consuming, and uses a great deal of water. A German project by the Fraunhofer Institutes, together with Munich University of Technology and various industrial partners, will put an end to this dilemma. Researchers are applying thin films, no more than 20 nanometers thick, to the inside surface of packaging in order to __________________.

When we have made an error, as for example in adding up a column of figures, we have a tendency to repeat it again and again. This phenomenon is known as the persistent error. The same thing happens when we try to solve a problem; each time our thoughts take a certain course, that course is more likely to be followed the next time. The reason that we keep making the same error repeatedly is that associations form between the ideas in the chain of thoughts and become firmer each time they are used, until finally the connections are so well established that ___________________. Thus, once we have adopted an unprofitable line of thought, it is harder to adopt a profitable line. 
① the chain is very difficult to break 
② persistent problems are solved automatically
③ the ideas lose their associations with one another 
④ those connections become weaker as time goes by 
⑤ the phenomenon will lead to a profitable line of thought

About three percent of the weight of sea water is accounted for by salt. The salt content of the ocean is being continually added to by runoff from the land, but it is not increasing. Yet salt cannot leave the sea by evaporation because the water vapor leaves it behind. So for many years it was a mystery as to why the sea should ________________, given the rate of runoff, and particularly if the world was supposed to be hundreds of millions of years old. The riddle was not solved until the 1970s, when the deep ocean openings were discovered. Sea water is swallowed up by these cracks in the ocean bed; when it reemerges, millions of years later, as steam from volcanoes, the salt has been filtered out of it on its passage through the rocks. 
① be so deep and large 
② create so much runoff 
③ have so little salt in it
④ have so many volcanoes
⑤ keep its temperature so steady

Early photography continued the trend toward the imprisonment of the subject and the object of representation. During photography’s first decades, exposure times were quite long. ____(A)____, the daguerreotype process required exposures of four to seven minutes in the sun and from twelve to sixty minutes indoors.

Sometimes all a good cheese needs to stop it from going bad is a sympathetic ear. Researchers in France have come up with an ultrasonic sensor that will listen to cheese as it matures and warn cheese makers of defects. Cheese makers have to downgrade up to one-fifth of their produce because of undetected faults. If the new device works well, that problem could be reduced. The technique involves sending a low frequency ultrasonic signal through the cheese to a sensor at the other side. By measuring the change in the speed and size of the emerging signal, the moisture and porosity of the cheese can be mapped.

Nobody likes performance reviews. Employees are nervous they will hear nothing but criticism, and bosses are nervous their direct reports will respond defensively. So people generally keep their mouths shut. That is unfortunate because most employees need help figuring out how to improve their performance and advance their careers. Also, it can be harmful to the company if a lack of clear feedback leads to undesirable work behaviors. There is a way to avoid this problem. Managers can help employees learn adaptive techniques like acknowledging negative emotions and reframing fears and criticisms constructively to prevent destructive responses. Once people are comfortable asking for feedback, they will begin to see how they are doing relative to management’s priorities, and their work will be more in line with organizational goals. 
① necessity of a feedback-friendly working environment 
② improvement of working conditions for new employees
③ importance of roles of management in employee placement  
④ development of upper-level management training programs  
⑤ significance of a feedback analysis of the welfare policy

34. 다음 글에서 작곡가에 관한 필자의 주장으로 가장 적절한 것은? 
Composers describe their private world through the use of sound. Making such a description concrete and detailed requires not just inspiration but certain practical tools and skills. No matter what style of music you write, you need to understand dynamics and speed, the uses of harmony and rhythm. You also need to know the range and capabilities of instruments, the possibilities of the human voice, and the problems of acoustics. You need to be able to devise a blueprint that communicates to your musicians what it is you want to hear. A young composer who takes a shortcut in this technical training in his rush to play the role of a composer will dry up very fast. If you learn the proper techniques, then the passion, if it is genuine, will come through.

Costa Rica means ‘rich coast’ in Spanish. It was discovered in 1502 and named by Christopher Columbus, who thought it might be a land rich with gold. However, Costa Rica has no great mineral wealth. It has, instead, rich soil and a moderate climate. While other Latin American nations suffered exploitation from outside the region and developed societies split by class conflict between rich and poor, Costa Rica developed an agricultural economy made up of numerous small farmers. There was not great wealth, but what there was was spread evenly. Costa Rica continued its unusual development after it separated from Spain in 1821, becoming the first Latin American country to abolish slavery. In 1889 the little nation held the first free election in Latin America.

37. TLA에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
In the early 1960s, Jill Norris, the mother of two sons with learning difficulties, began to exchange appropriate toys with other families; out of this she founded the Toy Libraries Association (TLA). The association opened toy libraries in community centers, clinics, schools, public libraries, and hospitals around the world. From these toy libraries parents and children could borrow toys knowing that they have been thoroughly tried and tested, not only for their play value but also for safety. Over the years, the association has involved leading professional educators and therapists, alongside parents, in the production of numerous publications on specific toys and aspects of play. In its early years, the association was opposed by the toy industry because it was likely to reduce sales of toys as children were borrowing them.

Clients send a steady stream of clues and messages through their facial expression, body movement, and voice pitch. Counselors need to learn how to read these messages without distorting or overinterpreting them in order to establish and maintain relationships with their clients. For instance, when Denise says to Jennie, “It seems that it’s hard for you to talk about yourself,” Jennie says, “No, I don’t mind at all.” But the real answer is probably in her nonverbal behavior, for she speaks hesitatingly while looking away and frowning. Reading such clues helps Denise understand Jennie better. Our nonverbal behavior has a way of ‘leaking’ messages about what we really mean. The unplanned nature of nonverbal behavior contributes to this leakage even in the case of highly defensive clients.

Sweeping statements have been made about the effect of clothing on the behavior of a child. It has been said that a child who is better dressed is better behaved, and that a child who is dressed like a cowboy is louder than he is when dressed in ordinary clothes. Clothing, however, might have a temporary effect on the behavior of the child, but not a lasting effect. That is, we would predict that a child who was dressed in his best clothes and whose mother stressed that they were ‘best’ would be better behaved for a short period, but by the end of the hour the child would have forgotten his clothes and would be acting as he would in old clothes. Likewise, the child who is dressed in a cowboy outfit might be very noisy while playing cowboys for a brief time, but he might soon change to another activity and be no more noisy than usual.

Due to this trade, the plant variety became widespread in a region. 

For thousands of years, farmers at harvest time have selected seeds, cuttings, or tubers from superior plants to save for the next planting. (①) Farmers often protected the stored seeds from insects or animals by sealing them in clay pots or burying them in baskets covered with ash. (②) They also often stored tubers in cold areas and either replanted cuttings immediately or kept them dry until the next planting time. (③) Farmers thus saved their genetic stocks from season to season. (④) They could exchange remaining stocks with neighbors or exchange them in the local market. (⑤) Organized seed production, however, did not begin until the early 1900s.

A study found that enrollment in physical education classes was not related to academic achievement scores, but involvement in vigorous physical activity was. Students who engaged in vigorous activity outside of school at least 20 minutes per day, three days per week, were found to have higher academic scores. Students in the physical education class spent an average of only 19 minutes out of a 55-minute class engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Given that this amount and intensity of activity in physical education classes had no correlation to students’ academic achievement, whereas there was a significant association between academic achievement and vigorous activity outside of school, the researchers propose that there may be a certain minimum level of activity necessary to produce the potentially desirable effects.

The tragic heroes in Shakespeare’s plays have free will. They possess their own defects of character that bring their downfalls. Macbeth is ambitious but weak; Othello is jealous; Hamlet cannot make up his mind but all three might have made themselves into better human beings. Nothing outside themselves prevents them from taking the right path as opposed to the wrong, or tragic, path. On the other hand, for the heroes in Greek tragedies where fate embodied in the oracles prevails, there is no free will. The gods control a man’s destiny, and one cannot fight the gods. Regardless of their strength or wisdom, the heroes cannot control their own future. That is why the heroes in Greek tragedies can be compared to fish in the net.  *oracle: 신탁(神託)

When we look at the world and ourselves, we do it through a set of filters. Think about what a filter is. A filter is a mechanism that lets some things flow in but screens other things out. 

(A) Through them, we process and assign a weight and meaning to every event in our lives. Some things flow in, others are screened out, but everything is affected: not just what we ‘see,’ but what we ‘hear’ and ‘believe.’ 
(B) Depending on what the filter is made up of, it can also alter whatever is looked at or passes through it. Sunglasses are a good example of a visual filter. 
(C) But, obviously, I am not talking here about some physical apparatus that we can put on and take off, like a pair of glasses. In fact, the filters I am mentioning are internal, mental, emotional, verbal, and perceptual in nature.

The descriptions of sound production have been rewritten in this edition so as to update the theory on which they were based and to provide better practical advice regarding pronunciation problems. Several figures have been redrawn in order to achieve greater accuracy and clearer detail. The authors have tried to eliminate traces of gender-biased attitudes wherever they were detected, and a definite attempt has been made to balance female and male references. The most significant kind of change in the new edition, however, is the result of the effort we have made to introduce more use of language for real communicative purposes in the learning activities suggested for students to carry out.

The introduction of the player piano in the United States at the turn of the 20th century had been accompanied by fairly critical comments. Player pianos produced music mechanically through a set of instructions stored on a music roll. Although proponents of the player piano such as piano manufacturers and publishers of sheet music thought that it would lead to ‘an almost universal music education,’ many music teachers, musicians, and composers opposed it. Opponents claimed that one could copy sound, but not interpretation, and that mechanical instruments reduced the expression of music to mathematical systems. For this reason, they believed that mechanized music lessened the ideal of beauty by ‘producing the same after same, with no soul, no joy, no passion,’ and that the introduction of the player piano would lead to the disappearance of amateur players. 
* proponent: 옹호자

While some believed that the player piano would provide a universal music education, others criticized its ____(A)____ music from a(n) ____(B)____ viewpoint.

(A) 
Several years ago, we were asked to help with the merger of two community volunteer groups, who wanted to join together in order to establish an agency that would have more influence and better financing than the two separate agencies of the past. Both were rural groups, which had traditionally and geographically been separated by a range of mountains. 
(B) 
In leading the planning meetings of the two boards, he carefully kept the groups focused on the long-range issues, and convinced them not to look at the headquarters question until the very end of the process. Once the organizational structure was set, by-laws agreed upon, and all the volunteers had actually merged, then the headquarters site was decided on logically and easily, as it turned out. 
(C) 
We worked with the two groups to help them set goals, develop policy, and build an organizational structure. Meanwhile, the young executive director, who saw a successful merger as his primary responsibility, was especially careful about one thing. On either side of the mountain was a large town. Each of the former agencies had its own board, a separate staff, and long-standing regional ties. The executive director understood that the question of where the new joint agency’s headquarters would be was an important question as well as a potentially explosive one. 
(D) 
By then everyone was so committed to the organization and its goals that the headquarters question had become a relatively unimportant, routine one. The executive director of the merging agencies was primarily concerned about the long-range good of the organization and the total community. He used all his influence and persuasive powers to make that a common focus, and the results were successful.

   It was spring and some 6th grade boys at a suburban elementary school were fooling around on the playground. They had discovered a great new trick. One of them would kneel down behind someone and the other would push the person over. The trick worked perfectly with (a) Anna. She fell over with ease. She was hurt and crying. In the process (b) she had broken her wrist. The yard duty staff sent the shaken boys to the principal. 
   The principal began by saying that she understood that they were playing and had not meant to cause serious harm, but that, in fact, they had. She explained that the girl would have to wear a cast for weeks and now lots of ordinary things would be more difficult for (c) her. She pointed out that the girl played the flute and would now not be able to play in the spring concert. By the time (d) she finished, the boys were in tears and very sorry for what they had done. The principal also suspended the boys for a day, explaining to them that even though she knew they were sorry and had not meant to cause such harm, she believed suspension was necessary to signal to everyone in the community the seriousness of the situation.

Work assignments, the number of machines, and production rates are coordinated so that all operations performed along this work successfully together. All movement of product parts on this is simplified, with no crossing over, backtracking, or repetition. This is increasingly being handled by computers, which monitor information and adjust the flow of parts accordingly. This usually consists of conveyor belts on which workers perform specific functions. Nowadays, automatic machinery and industrial robots are taking the place of human workers on this.

We are addicted to our cars. We do not think twice before driving to pick something up at a store that is only three blocks away. In fact, we romanticize driving with our thoughts of long Sunday drives and adventurous cross-country road trips. Well, we need to get rid of this addiction — and fast — because driving is harmful to our health and to our planet’s health. The air pollutants that spit out from the car exhaust pipes have been proven to cause cancer, and the carbon dioxide that is emitted causes global warming. One of the easiest ways to reduce these emissions is simply to change our mind-set about driving. We need to make driving our last choice of transportation to live a happy, healthy life. And the first step in achieving this new mind-set is to reorganize our lives so we do not need to drive much or far.

Furniture is among the oldest engineering structures designed to carry a rather well-defined load under rather well-defined circumstances. We are not surprised that furniture used beyond its intended purpose is broken, and we readily blame the child who abuses the furniture rather than the designer of the furniture or the furniture itself when it is abused. Thus a chair must support a person in a sitting position, but it might not be expected to survive a fall from a tall building. A child’s bed might be expected to support a sleeping child, but it would not necessarily be considered badly designed if it collapsed under the child’s wild use of it as a trampoline.

A vendor in a city set up shop and sold doughnuts and coffee to passersby. During the breakfast and lunch hours, he always had long lines of customers waiting. He noticed that, as he was a one-man show, the biggest bottleneck preventing him from selling more doughnuts and coffee was the disproportionate amount of time it took to make change for his customers. Finally, he simply put a small basket on the side of his stand filled with dollar bills and coins. Most customers responded by being completely honest, often leaving him larger-than-normal tips. Also, he was able to move customers through at twice the pace because he did not have to make change. In addition, he found that his customers liked this idea and kept coming back. By ____________ in this way, he was able to double his sales.

They are afraid to be the first to say, “I love you.” They do not ask for help from people they do not know well. In short, they do not let their wants and needs be known because they are afraid of being turned away. But the wonderful truth is this: If you can accept NO for an answer, you can fearlessly ask for whatever you need. It is also true that you will not receive if you do not ask. So do not be afraid to ask! You may be surprised at the number of people willing to help.

Laura invests in company B and considers switching to company A and she decides to do so. They both find out that they would have been better off by $1,000 if they had taken different actions. Who do you think feels more regret? Most people judge that Laura will regret her action more than Mary will regret her inaction.

The spread of prosperity, the single-family home, the invention of television and computers have all made it possible for us to live private lives unimaginable to previous generations. We no longer live in close quarters with our neighbors, we can move about without crowding into buses or trains; we do not have to go to theaters or share our tastes with our neighbors. However, the same technologies that help separate us from the crowds also make it possible to monitor and record our behaviors. Although fewer people have intimate knowledge of our lives, many people — mostly unknown to us — know something about us. The very technology that was supposed to free us from mass society has turned out to be as much a fishbowl as an information highway. In modern society, we have discovered that ____________.
① people cannot use public transportation because of crowding
② technology makes us independent from natural environments
③ more people become indifferent to the spread of prosperity
④ cooperating with people leads to wrong conclusions
⑤ being free often means also being naked

Growing native plants in a garden is catching on like wildfire. Natives often attract more birds and pollinators such as bees and butterflies, increasing their diversity to your garden. Imitating a native landscape in an isolated urban yard, however, does not do all that much to make up for lost native habitat. So what is the most ecological use of your garden? At the top of the list is gardening for your own food. There is no reason that what you plant for birds, butterflies, and bees cannot also feed you and your family. Sunflowers are often called ‘nature’s bird feeders,’ but you can plant enough to share the oil-rich seeds. Many fruit trees in your garden can also feed both birds and you.

Conditioning occurs indirectly, which adds to its impact on us. Let’s say, for example, that you watch another person get an electric shock. Each time, a signal light comes on before the shock is delivered. Even if you do not receive a shock yourself, you will soon develop an emotional response to the light. Children who learn to fear thunder by watching their parents react to it have undergone similar conditioning. If horror movies can affect us, we might expect the emotions of parents, friends, and relatives to have even more impact. How, for instance, does a city child learn to fear snakes and respond emotionally to mere pictures of them? Being told that “snakes are dangerous” may not explain the child’s emotional response. More likely, the child has observed others reacting fearfully to the word snake or to snake images on television.

More than thirty wonderful poems are presented in this collection of his poetry, along with special illustrations that capture the spirit of the poetry.

So pack your imagination and get ready to take a special trip with the words of Carl Sandburg.

37. The barrier at the River Scheldt에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The barrier at the River Scheldt in the Netherlands is the world’s largest tidal surge barrier. It protects Zeeland from the constant threat of flooding. Completed in 1987, it forms part of the Delta Project, a line of massive sea-defenses, which was constructed after disastrous floods in 1953. As originally planned, the barrier was to be a solid dam that, by drastically restricting tidal flows, would have destroyed much of the marine environment on the Eastern Scheldt. In 1973, however, a campaign forced the project to be suspended. The project was revived four years later in a new and greatly modified form. Instead of being permanently sealed, the redesigned barrier is now normally open to the tides, restricting their flow by only 25 percent. It is only when water levels reach 3 meters above normal that steel gates close shut, holding back even the most extreme waters.   *surge: 범람

38. precocial birds에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
The young of precocial birds belonging to the same clutch have a strong incentive to hatch as close together in time as possible. The mother and the first-hatched young will be on the move within hours; chicks left behind in the eggs will die. When the eggs of these species are incubated separately, the hatching times are spread over a period of days; but when they are kept together, hatching times are close by, within one or two hours. This coordinated hatching is achieved by sound signals exchanged by the chicks while they are still in the eggs. The most characteristic sound is a regular loud click, which is most persistent just prior to hatching. It is not caused by a tapping against the shell, but is a vocalization associated with breathing movements.
*precocial: 부화 후 곧 활동하는
**clutch 한배의 새끼들
① 한 배의 새끼들은 가능한 한 서로 가까운 시간에 부화하려는 강한 동기가 있다.

We know where we are headed and what we want to do. However, quite often, due to forces outside our control, things do not go as we had planned and we have to adjust to a postponement or create a whole new set of circumstances. This is what happens when life throws us a curveball. The fact is that life is unpredictable. For example, your car breaks down and you are late for an appointment. While it is true that you never arrive at that important meeting, you end up spending a few relaxing hours with people you would never have met otherwise. Remember that not only are curveballs the universe’s way of keeping us awake —which is a gift in and of itself — but they are also its method of bringing us wonderful surprises.

When my son was seven years old, we went to a dolphin show. After the show, I went up to the trainer and asked, “How did you get the dolphin to do all these really neat things?” The trainer looked at my son and me and said, “Unlike many parents, whenever the dolphin does anything like what I want him to do, I notice him! I give him a hug and a fish.” The light went on in my head. Whenever my son did what I wanted him to do, I paid little attention to him. However, when he did not, I gave him a lot of attention because I did not want to raise a bad kid! I was unintentionally teaching him to be a little monster in order to get my attention. Since that day, I have tried hard to notice my son’s good acts and downplay his mistakes.

The person who wrote of a building bringing gladness to the viewer reminds us of the importance of beauty in human life. Biologists account for the human desire for art in other terms. They explain that human beings have very large brains that demand stimulation. Curious, active, and inventive, we humans constantly explore, and in so doing invent things that appeal to our senses — fine arts, fine food, fine scents, and fine music. Art has mostly been considered in terms of seeking beauty, but there are other reasons deeply rooted in the human experience that create needs for art. For one, humans also reflect on the nature of things and the meaning of life. Visually and verbally, we constantly communicate with each other; in our need to understand and our need to communicate, the arts serve a vital function.

② Societal Roles of Inventions

It is possible to observe a basic and sometimes unexplainable division in the animal world. Some species crowd together and require physical contact with each other. Others avoid touching. No apparent logic governs the category into which a species falls. Curiously enough, closely related animals may belong to different categories. The great Emperor penguin is a contact species. It conserves heat through contact with its fellows in large groups. The smaller Adelie penguin is a non-contact species. Thus it is somewhat less adaptable to cold than the Emperor. Other functions served by contact behavior are unknown. One could guess that, since contact animals are more ‘involved’ with each other, their social organization and possibly their manner of exploiting the environment might be different from those of non-contact animals.
① Dangers Caused by Cold to Some Animal Species 
② Conflicts Between Contact and Non-contact Species
③ Relationship Between Temperature and Animal Survival 
④ Reproduction Patterns of Different Animal Species 
⑤ Categorization of Animals by Their Contact Behaviors

But the strong pig can race to the dispenser and push the weak pig aside to claim the leftovers.

Consider the following experiment with a strong and a weak pig. Two pigs are kept in a box with a lever at one end and a food dispenser at the other. When the lever is pushed, food appears at the dispenser. ( ① ) If the weak pig pushes the lever, the strong pig waits by the dispenser and eats all the food. ( ② ) Even if the weak pig races to the dispenser before the food is gone, the strong pig pushes the weak pig away. ( ③ ) The weak pig realizes this, so it never pushes the lever first. ( ④ ) On the other hand, if the strong pig pushes the lever, the weak pig waits by the dispenser and eats most of the food. ( ⑤ ) This makes it worthwhile for the strong pig to push the lever. The outcome is that the strong pig does all the work and the weak pig does most of the eating.  *dispenser: 일정량을 배분해 주는 장치

 The face of the water, in time, became a wonderful book — a book that was a dead language to the uneducated passenger, but which told its mind to the pilot without reserve, delivering its most cherished secrets as clearly as if it spoke them with a voice. The passenger who could not read this book saw nothing but all manner of pretty pictures in it, painted by the sun and shaded by the clouds. To the pilot, however, it was a highlighted passage. Indeed, it was more than that; for it meant that a wreck or a rock was buried there that could tear the life out of the strongest vessel that ever floated. It is the faintest and simplest expression the water ever makes, and the most frightening to a pilot’s eye.     *pilot: 수로 안내인   

▶ To the passenger, the face of the water reflects ＿＿(A)＿＿ whereas to the pilot it reveals ＿＿(B)＿＿.

  As we explore together the virtual world that floats on the edge of this material life, the many imaginative territories you inhabit bring back another reality. I catch images of my own childhood wanderings through Narnia, the land of hobbits, and Mowgli’s jungle. All these are deep pleasures which combine all my senses and momentarily transport me into another dimension of living.
  If I were to bring it all together I would say that among all the misery, fear, injustice, and pain, I hope you will not forget moments when all this fades away into periods of innocent joy. It is when we bring all our powerful senses together, perhaps in a moment in the garden of earthly delights that we ＿＿＿＿＿ over despair.
  So the moment when you dance to Handel or when you sit in a pool of wild flowers, or gravely take part in your first tea ceremony, these are the moments you will treasure. They are, with similar moments with friends and loved ones, what makes being human bearable.       *hobbit: Tolkien 작품에 나오는 등장인물

【48~50】다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
  When I first began teaching, I was invited to a workshop for new professors. Like most people who teach at universities, I had spent a long time learning what to teach, but none learning how to teach it. Somehow, my university seemed to hope, a weekend spent with experienced professors would make up for that. My colleagues presented well-crafted lectures about the tools they used in the classroom. I enjoyed their presentations, but do not remember a thing they said.
(B)
  When we were called to the next talk, he put down his cup and I noticed there was not a trace of coffee in it. I thought that was rather odd, and said so. “My doctor told me to stop drinking coffee,” he explained. “So I have always used an empty cup. Doesn’t make any difference.” I decided to try his idea in my class, but not with an empty cup.
(C)
  I took a cup of coffee with me to my next class Monday morning. It helped. My pauses, as I drank the coffee, not only gave my students time to think about what I had said, but gave me time to think about what I was going to say next. I began to use my pauses to look around the room to see how my students were reacting to what I had just said. When I saw their attention wander, I tried to bring them back. When I saw them puzzled over some concept that I thought I had explained, I gave another example. My lectures became less organized and less brilliant, but my students seemed to understand me better.
(D)
  One thing that I do remember happened at a coffee break. Finding myself alone, I turned to a mathematics professor standing nearby. I asked him what his favorite teaching tool was. “A cup of coffee,” he said. I asked him how he used it. “Well,” he said, “I talk too much and too fast in the classroom. Students sometimes have trouble following me. So every once in a while, when I’ve said something I want my students to think about, I stop and take a sip of coffee. It lets what I’ve just said sink in.”

This, in the simplest definition, is a promise enforceable by law. The promise may be to do something or to stop from doing something. The making of this requires the mutual agreement of two or more persons or parties, one of them ordinarily making an offer and another accepting, If one of the parties fails to keep the promise, the other has rights to compensation. The law about this considers such questions as whether this exists, what the meaning of this is, whether this has been broken, and what compensation is due to the injured party.

Upon receiving your last letter, I rushed to look up the word 'flattering' in the dictionary, I was shocked to find out that it could imply something negative, which I certainly did not mean. I should have used some wordlike 'complimentary' instead. For that, I would like to ask for the kindness in your heart to forgive my unintended offense. If you knew me well, you would know that I am shameless enough to take all compliments at their face value and not to think that they might be mere flattery. I just did not know what the word really implied, I hope that you no longer feel hurt or uncomfortable in any way as a result of our correspondence.

24.  In this modem world, People are not used to living with discomfort. We expect immediate results and satisfaction. We want answers faster than they can be delivered.

People no longer know how to wait, or even what waiting means, It is nice to have what you want when you want it, but the ability to delay satisfaction is important.           is clearly an important virtue, yet so many people stand in front of their microwaves thinking “Hurry up!”

25.  The goal of medicine as it is currently practiced is to develop procedures and drugs that work equally well on all patients, regardless of gender, age, or genetics, It derives from the prevalent belief that all of us are similar bio-mechanical units that rolled off the same assembly line - a most imperfect conception of human beings that limits conventional medicine's effectiveness. The doctor of the future, however, needs to practice medicine in fundamentally different ways. One of the most important shifts will be an increased recognition of             , a concept now largely ignored. Instead of treating different patients that display similar symptoms with the same drugs, doctors should identify root causes of disease to come up with a personalized treatment.

26.   For the most part, we like things that are familiar to us. To prove the point to yourself, try a little experiment. Get the negative of an old photograph that shows a front view of your face and have it developed into a pair of pictures one that shows you as you actually look and one that shows a reverse image so that the right and left sides of your face are interchanged. Now decide which version of your face you like better and ask a good friend to make the choice, too. If you are like most people, you should notice something odd: Your friend will prefer the true print, but you will prefer the reverse image. Why? Because you both will be responding favorably to the more familiar face - your friend to              and you to the reversed one you find in the mirror every day. [3점]

Nearly everyone who heard the altered recording could report that they heard both a sentence and static. But a majority of people could not tell where the static was! The auditory system had filled in the missing speech information, so that the sentence seemed uninterrupted. Most people reported that there was static and that it existed apart from the spoken sentence. The static and the sentence formed separate perceptual streams due to differences in the quality of sound that caused them to group separately.                      * static: 잡음(雜音)
① recognizes incorrect pronunciation
② plays an important role in speaking
③ has its own version of perceptual completion
④ reacts differently according to different languages
⑤ analyzes auditory and visual cues at the same time

28.   Not all authors trusted that the theater audience would automatically understand their plays in the intended manner. Thus, they repeatedly attempted to make it clear to their public that visiting the theater was not merely for the purpose of entertainment, but rather to draw lessons from the play offered onstage. It was, therefore, important for the viewer                so as to facilitate interpretation of the content. This idea was developed by Bertolt Brecht with his ‘epic theater,’ which used alienation as a strategy to prevent the identification of the public with the figures of the drama. Through scattered narration and commentary throughout the play, for example, the viewers are invited to take a step back from the performance. In this way, they are given hints to better understand the play while the conclusion is left open so as to leave them to draw their own conclusions.  [3점]

② to learn about the play beforehand 
③ to identify himself with the actors on the stage

After dinner he built a fire, going out into the weather for wood he had piled against the garage. The air was bright and cold against his face, and the snow in the driveway was already halfway to his knees. He gathered logs, shaking off their soft white caps and carrying them inside. He sat for a time in front of the fireplace, cross-legged, adding logs, and gazing at the warm fire. Outside, snow continued to fall quietly in the cones of light cast by the streetlights. By the time he rose and looked out the window, his car had become a soft white hill on the edge of the street.

Figures A and B demonstrate how dew point is measured by a dew point hygrometer. In Figure A, light is transmitted from a laser and ① reflected off the mirror onto a receiver that measures the intensity of the observed light. When the mirror temperature is above dew point and the intensity of the transmitted light is 10 mW/cm2, the intensity of the observed light is ② the same . In Figure B, when the mirror temperature is at dew point, dew drops cover the ③ surface of the mirror. When the transmitted light hits the dew drops, it becomes ④ scattered. As a consequence, compared to the intensity of the transmitted light, that of the observed light measured by the receiver is ⑤ increased.

33. Imagine that you are in a meeting. Your party and the other party are sitting across a table. You ask a question on a particular subject and the answer is unsatisfactory. What would be the best response? It is none at all. So if you are seeking more information or a different kind of information, ask for it by remaining silent. When there is a long pause in the conversation, people feel an overwhelming need to fill it. If someone has finished speaking and you do not play along by taking up your end of the dialog, that person will automatically start to elaborate. Eventually, they may say what you want to hear.

Every element in an ecosystem depends on every other element, even the so-called nonliving elements such as minerals, oxygen, and sunlight. Yes, light is an integral element of all life. The sun is food for many of earth’s life forms. Physicists speak of photons of light as being interchangeable. When the light from an object hits a person, only some of it bounces off. Most of the photons are absorbed into the person. Its energy becomes that person’s energy. This is how incredible interdependence is everything is constantly becoming everything else.			 * photon: 광자(光子)

The graph above shows the growth rate of total output in the U.S. from 1960 to 1999. The growth rate of total output is equal to the growth rate in the number of hours worked plus the growth rate of labor productivity. ① The 1960-1969 period displayed the highest growth rate of total output of all the periods in the graph. ② The growth rate of total output declined from the 1960-1969  period to the 1980-1989 period. ③ The only period where the growth rate in the number of hours worked exceeded the labor productivity growth rate was the 1980 1989 period. ④ The 1990-1994 period showed an increase in the growth rate of total output from the 1980-1989 period. ⑤ The 1995-1999 period displayed the second highest growth rate of total output and the greatest labor productivity growth rate of all the time periods.

Like its largemouth cousin, the smallmouth bass is a native of the Mississippi drainage, which makes it a true heartland fish. Whereas the largemouth likes slow or still water with lots of food-holding weeds, the smallmouth prefers clean, rocky bottoms and swifter water, ideally in the range of 65° to 68°F. In waters warmer than 73°F, you can forget about finding one. In lakes, smallmouth often school up, which means that if you catch one, you can catch a bunch. In rivers and streams, they are more solitary. The smallmouth has a series of dark vertical bands along its sides. The dorsal fin is one continuous fin (as opposed to the separated dorsal fin of the largemouth).				* dorsal fin: 등지느러미

Starting in the 1960s, People began flooding into Chattanooga, a former factory town, to explore its caves, rivers, and cliffs. Before long more than 3,800 caves surrounding the city had been discovered. The nearby Ocoee was among the most paddled rivers in the country and six major climbing sites sprang up within an hour’s drive of city limits. But in spite of this boundless outdoors potential, there remained the problem of Chattanooga proper, a post-industrial wasteland that made the city the kind of place you would visit but would never want to live in. Not, that is, until lately. Over the past decade, Chattanooga has made an incredible urban come back: electric buses, organic markets, and a 120-million-dollar riverfront restoration project completed last year. In addition, beautiful modem architecture such as the post-modem museum and the newly remodeled aquarium plays a big role in the comeback of Chattanooga.

38. In practical situations where there is no room for error, we have learned to avoid vagueness in communication. A fire chief, for example, needs to issue his orders with absolute clarity. In imaginative situations, however, there is the danger that too much specificity can limit your imagination. Let’s suppose that the same fire chief has asked you to paint a picture on the side of his firehouse. If he tells you what he wants it to look like right down to the last detail, he has not given you any room for your imagination. However, if the assignment were stated somewhat vaguely, then you would have more room to think and be more creative.

39. Although a speech can be effective, all the words in the world cannot measure up to the example of a leader, especially in communicating new behaviors and values. There is often no more effective way to help people understand the message than to have it modeled for them by the manager. Words can yield a variety of interpretations in terms of the kind of behaviors people think they mean. But a manager’s actions provide a clear model of exactly the kind of behavior required. Managers who want people to take a more team-based approach with their people, for example, will almost certainly get better results by taking a more team-based approach themselves rather than just by making a speech on teamwork.

However, now that the economy is characterized more by the exchange of information than by hard goods, geographical centrality has been replaced by attempts to create a sense of cultural centrality.

Now, as always, cities are desperate to create the impression that they lie at the center of something or other. ( ① ) This idea of centrality may be locational, namely that a city lies at the geographical center of England, Europe, and so on. ( ② ) This draws on a well-established notion that geographical centrality makes a place more accessible, easing communication and communication costs. ( ③ ) Cultural centrality usually demonstrates itself as a cry that a city is at the center of the action. ( ④ ) This means that the city has an abundance of cultural activities, such as restaurants, theater, ballet, music, sport, and scenery. ( ⑤ ) The suggestion is that people will want for nothing in this city.

41. Young children rarely think of their art as personal property. Often they throw it away or give it away. This suggests that much of the value of art for a child consists in making it. Interestingly, art in tribal societies is frequently abandoned after it has served its purpose. The focus is on the magical, expressive, and social value of the act of making. Some contemporary artists share this feeling, but they are also caught up in the system of art exhibition, the selling of their art, and the requirements of an art market. This results in a tension in the art world that is largely unresolved -1he tension between art as a satisfying mode of expression and art as a precious collectible object, between the experience of making and the experience of owning.

42. The age of 3 is not without its charm. One of the more amusing aspects of this age is the child’s often vivid imagination, expressed most strikingly in his enjoyment of imaginary companions. Though some people have felt that only the lonely play with imaginary playmates, our research makes it very evident that it is often the highly superior and imaginative child who invents these creatures. They are very real to him, very important, and, we can assure you, quite harmless. Even though it may be annoying to have to lay a place at dinner or keep an extra seat in the family automobile for his ‘friend’ who exists only in your child's imagination, it is probably well worthwhile.

Rosalyn’s parents did everything possible to avoid favoring one child over the others, and this resulted in her feelings being hurt. One year Rosalyn asked her mother to prepare a special treat for her birthday: the honey cake that Rosalyn had always loved.	

(A) Upon receiving the cake, Rosalyn became disappointed. It was, after all, her birthday; couldn't she be singled out on one day of the year? A parent’s admirable efforts not to play favorites can mean that no child gets the whole cake of parental love.
(B) Her mother said she couldn't. If she made a honey cake for Rosalyn, she’d have to make cakes for Rosalyn’s two sisters, and she didn't have time to make three cakes.
(C) In the end, her mother did give Rosalyn a honey cake on her birthday - a really small one, because she split the batter for one cake into three parts, to treat her daughters equally.

How can you create closeness when the two of you are hundreds of miles apart? How can you make the person you are talking to on the phone feel special when you cannot pat their back or give them a little hug? The answer is simple. Just use your caller's name far more often than you would in person, In fact, shower your conversations with his or her name. Saying a person's name too often in face-to-face conversation sounds manipulative. However, on the phone the effect is dramatically different. If you heard someone say your name, even if you were being pushed around in a big noisy crowd, you would pay attention and listen.

Many years ago, psychologists performed an experiment in which they put a number of people in a room, alone except for a ring toss set. It was one of those children’s toys with a short wooden post held upright on the floor and a bunch of round rings. The subjects were left alone to amuse themselves as best they could. As expected, with time to kill, they began trying to toss the rings around the post. What the psychologists discovered was that most of the people moved far enough away from the post so that tossing the rings around it was challenging but not so difficult as to be totally frustrating. In other words, they deliberately positioned themselves between frustration on the one hand and boredom on the other. The process of alternately producing and relieving tension was what made the activity stimulating.

(A)
On the wall of our dining room was a framed quotation: “Let me live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man.” It inspired in me countless childhood daydreams about meeting new people from exotic places. I was a child who desperately wanted to connect with others. We did live ‘by the side of the road’ - on Route 9 between Keene and Portsmouth - but in a place so remote it was extremely difficult to be a ‘friend to man.’

(B)
Why couldn’t others also benefit from that value? I could save people the trouble of going into the store by making my produce accessible at the side of the road, and that would provide value, too. Surely I could convince people to pay half of what the grocery store charged and to feel lucky about the bargain. Suddenly, I saw a connection between those bumpy vegetables on our table and the quotation on the wall; I found a way to satisfy my longing for                  These homely fruits and vegetables would become my golden apples.	

(C)
One day when our family drove into town, I focused intently on the big, paper, grocery store signs advertising the same type of produce that we grew: ‘carrots, 50 cents a bunch,’ ‘tomatoes, 99 cents a pound.’ Meanwhile, I thought of how the type of ‘imperfect’ produce we ate for dinner, just as healthy as that sold at the store, was often tossed on the compost heap or left in the ground.		 
                         * compost heap: 퇴비 더미

(D)
The unattractive produce such as crooked carrots and odd-looking tomatoes was not valuable to the grocery store, where only ‘perfect’ produce was sold. But I knew they would have value to people who would chop them into salads or soups, can them, or use them to make pies, because that is what our family did with them. They were fresh and clean and came straight from the good earth.

A friend of mine and his wife were in Hawaii, standing on a beach, watching a beautiful sunset-hardly able to believe how magnificent the sight was. A woman approached them and overheard my friend’s wife say, “I can’t believe how beautiful this is.” While walking away from the spectacular display, the woman said, “You should have seen it in Tahiti.”
When your attention is not on the present moment but on something else, you will tend to                 , as the Tahiti traveler did, or you will wonder about future experiences instead of enjoying the present one, and regret past experiences because they are already over. But as you learn to bring your attention back to the here and now, life will come alive again, providing the enjoyment and satisfaction it was meant to. Thus, when you live in the present moment, one of the nice things that happens to you is that ordinary, everyday life takes on a new significance. Taking walks, watching a sunset, gardening, reading a book, all begin to feel special. When your attention is brought back to the here and now, you engage in life rather than think about life.
