It’s a question we’d all like answered: Is there life after
death? In November of 2009 I was pronounced clinically
dead. But the diagnosis was correct only up to a point. My
experience fed a fierce curiosity to know how “normal” such
experiences are. Since that time, I have interviewed 184
people who have also been to the “other side” and returned.
I have a diverse collection of anecdotal evidence that there
is indeed more to life than life. Would you be interested in
seeing some or all of my 70,000‑word manuscript? I can
send the complete manuscript, or if you prefer, sample
chapters and a detailed synopsis. I look forward to hearing
from you as soon as possible.
① 출판 기념회에 초대하려고
② 인터뷰 요청을 거절하려고

Phyllis has arranged to take the morning off to spend time
with her daughter, Gloria. Phyllis is so happy that ① she is
able to spend time with her little angel. Things are moving
right on schedule and ② she heads to the supermarket with
her daughter. Time passes, and with only an hour left before
getting to the office, Phyllis becomes conscious of the clock.
Phyllis tries to place her daughter in the shopping cart, but
③ she repeatedly screams “NO SIT!” With a nervous grin on
her face, Phyllis masks the anger she feels. ④ She has
never been challenged so strongly by Gloria. In all the mess
of the scene, Phyllis does not realize the significance of the
event. For the very first time, ⑤ she heard Gloria put two
words together to express a thought.
20. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 어법상 틀린 것은?
Archaeologist Mark Aldenderfer set out last year to explore
remote cliffside caves in Nepal’s Mustang district, aiming to
find human remains near an ancient settlement ① high in the
Himalayas. Almost at once, he came face‑to‑face with ②what
he was seeking: Sticking out from the rock, a skull was
looking at him right ③ as he was looking at it. The skull,
dating back perhaps 2,500 years, was among many human
bones ④ piled inside several burial caves. Aldenderfer and his
team hope that DNA analysis will pinpoint the origins of this
isolated region’s inhabitants, who may ⑤ migrate from the
Tibetan Plateau or southern points.

21. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현으로 가장
적절한 것은?
Ultrasound, an imaging technique, produces an image by
(A) bounce / bouncing sound waves off an object inside the
body. A picture is then made using the reflected sound
waves. The frequency of sound waves used in ultrasound
imaging (B) range / ranges above human hearing. The choice
of frequency depends on how deep into the body the sound
waves are needed to penetrate. Lower frequencies allow
doctors to see structures deeper inside the body. The lower
the frequency, however, the less (C) clear / clearly the image
will become. Doctors use ultrasound to visualize the size and
structure of internal organs.
 (A) (B) (C)
① bounce ······ range ······ clear
② bounce ······ ranges ······ clearly
③ bouncing ······ ranges ······ clear
④ bouncing ······ ranges ······ clearly
⑤ bouncing ······ range ······ clearly
22. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
We tend to consider water consumption in strictly
immediate terms, such as taking a shower or doing the
laundry. ① But it overlooks the inter‑connectivity of water
use and does not take into account “virtual water”
consumption. ② Virtual water refers to water used in the
production of an industrial or agricultural product. ③ A single
cotton T‑shirt, for example, requires over 700 gallons of
water to be brought into being. ④ Fabrics made of Egyptian
cotton are softer, finer and last longer than any other cotton
in the world. ⑤ While purchasing a T‑shirt involves no direct
water expenditure, the garment is the product of a large
investment of water resources.
23. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
According to a psychologist, a business executive spends an
hour of his day reading, two hours talking and eight hours
listening. Yet in school we spend a large amount of time
teaching children how to read, a small amount of time teaching
them how to speak, and usually no time at all teaching them
how to listen. I do not believe it would be a good thing to
make what we teach in school exactly proportional to what we
do after school, but I do think we would be wise to give our
children some instruction in the process of listening. Listening
well is an exercise of attention and those who listen well tend
to have good relationships with colleagues.
① 학생들에게 남의 말을 경청하는 법을 가르치자.
② 듣기와 읽기 훈련을 위한 수업 모형을 개발하자.
③ 의사소통이 잘 이루어지는 직장 분위기를 조성하자.
④ 생산성 향상을 위해 직장에서 집중력 훈련을 시키자.
⑤ 직장에서 동료들과 좋은 관계를 유지하도록 노력하자.

시오.
24. Years ago, I was involved in planning a police operation
that was to take place in Lakeland, Florida. As the mission
planner was describing the operation order, he seemed to
have everything covered. His arms were outstretched over
two chairs as he confidently explained the very detailed
arrest plan. Suddenly someone asked, “Have you contacted
the Lakeland ambulance crew?” Instantly the mission planner
withdrew his arms and dropped them between his knees,
palms together. He went from dominating a large space to
being as narrow as possible, all because he had not made
the necessary arrangements. He suddenly lost the initiative.
This is a striking example of how quickly our behaviors ebb
and flow depending on our level of .
① confidence ② intelligence ③ morality
④ patience ⑤ imagination
25. A “pot‑stirrer” is someone who brings up emotional issues
that have already been resolved. Pot‑stirrers want to feed
the emotional fire and keep it burning for the excitement of
the conflict. They can be subtle; they often even appear to
be the “helpful” friend or “caring” listener. Let’s say you’ve
just let go of a minor conflict with your neighbor, when
your other neighbor continues to bring up how annoying this
person is, encouraging you . The same
applies at work. A coworker keeps reminding you that it
was you, not Gail, who really deserved the credit for that
great idea. Every time he or she says it, it upsets you and
opens your wound again.
① to cooperate with your competitors
② to find the virtues of your neighbor
③ not to lose your inner peace of mind
④ to hold on to your irritation with the person
⑤ not to be involved in your neighbor’s business
26. Aristotle distinguished between essential and accidental
properties. Essential properties are those without which a
thing wouldn’t be what it is, and accidental properties are
those that determine how a thing is, but not what it is. For
example, Aristotle thought rationality was essential to being
a human being. Socrates’ rationality was essential to his
being Socrates. On the other hand, Aristotle thought Socrates’
property of being snub‑nosed was merely accidental; being
snub‑nosed was part of how Socrates was, but it wasn’t
essential to what or who he was. In other words, take away
Socrates’ rationality, and , but give him
plastic surgery, and he’s Socrates with a nose job.
① he becomes freer ② it removes how he is
③ he’s no longer Socrates ④ it explains why he lives
⑤ his essential being remains

27. A team of researchers found out the alarming low death
rate of a small village of Roseto and started to investigate
it. While investigating, they realized that the secret of
Roseto wasn’t diet or exercise or genes or location. They
looked at how the Rosetans visited one another. They
learned about the extended family clans that underlay the
town’s social structure. They saw how many homes had
three generations living under one roof, and how much
respect grandparents commanded. They noticed the particular
belief in equality of the community, which discouraged the
wealthy from boasting about their success and helped the
unsuccessful obscure their failures. These findings suggested
the Rosetans had created .
① a unique and effective farming method
② a healthy, well‑balanced diet for the old
③ an education system to maintain their culture
④ a closely connected and protective social structure
⑤ an economic policy increasing the income of the village
28. In a study, hundreds of participants were asked to watch a
short film and then discuss it with another participant. Half
the participants were given an “impression management goal”
to appear outgoing, smart, or happy. After the discussions,
participants rated themselves and the person they had chatted
with across several personality traits. Those with an
impression management goal rated their conversation partner
significantly lower on the trait they were trying to show in
themselves, but not on other personality traits. This seems
to happen because when we focus on exaggerating a
particular trait in ourselves, we unconsciously increase the
standard for that trait in others ― and they usually fall
short. So just because someone you’re trying to impress
doesn’t seem as active, friendly or positive as you are,
don’t assume that they truly aren’t. It could just be that
 has changed the game. [3점]
① how many partners you have to rate
② what kind of movie you’d like to see
③ what personality traits your partner possesses
④ how different your opinions about the movie are
⑤ what impression you are trying to give to others
29. Farmers plant more seeds than are necessary to ensure
full breeding. If more plants sprout than are necessary, the
extra plants should be pulled out, before they choke out the
most promising sprout. It can be difficult for farmers to kill
their own offspring, even though they know it’s for the best.
Writers sometimes face the same dilemma. You are faced
with tough choices where certain scenes you love and worked
hard on just don’t fit into the story. Maybe there is a
character you adore, but he does nothing to move the story
along. If you are getting good sound advice from all around
you that certain materials don’t work, think about being
flexible in order to . [3점]
① find a way to make your story more complex
② gather as many details as possible for your work
③ make sure you don’t choke out the story with them
④ conceal the place you want to go with your readers
⑤ have a good opportunity to analyze other people’s works
30. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
In Europe, if your industry declines and you lose your job,
it is a big blow but not the end of the world. You will still
keep your health insurance and public housing, while
receiving unemployment benefits, government‑subsidized
retraining and government help in your job search. (A) ,
if you are a worker in the US, you’d better hold on to your
current job because losing your job means losing almost
everything. Unemployment insurance coverage is smaller than
in Europe. There is little public help with retraining and job
search. More frighteningly, losing your job means losing your
health insurance and your home, as there is little public
housing or public subsidies for your rent. (B) , worker
resistance to any industrial restructuring that involves job
cuts is much greater in the US than in Europe.

It is the elderly who often suffer the most as temperatures
drop. Physiologically, their blood vessels are more liable to
(A) contract / expand and their blood pressure rises.
Financially, they are less likely to turn up the heating and
more likely to use public transport. Socially, they may have
fewer people around them to (B) identify / intensify their
problems. One of the effects of aging is that your body is
less able to regulate its temperature, so you become less
able to judge if you are warm or cold. Failing to keep
adequately warm can (C) adapt / expose older people to the
threat of cold‑related illnesses, which contribute to thousands
of excess winter deaths each year.

32. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중, 문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지
않은 것은?
We tend to think of the skin as a separate organ ― just a
① wrapping of our more delicate inner parts. But the skin is
connected to every system in the body ― from your circular
and digestive systems to your immune and nervous systems.
All must work ② interactively for total body health. Both
heart and skin, for example, rely on veins. This helps explain
why, when you get angry, your heart beats faster and your
face ③ reddens. This interconnectedness between the skin
and the internal body is largely forgotten by people who see
skin as a ④ connected entity. It’s a two‑way street. When
we damage the skin, we damage our insides. Similarly, what
we experience inside our bodies could have ⑤ indications on
the outside.
[33 ~ 34] 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
33. For many generations, scholars and artists tended to
concentrate their energy on one particular subject. For
Shakespeare, that interest was literature. For Mozart, that
interest was musical composition, and for Newton, physics.
Visual artists were not expected to understand higher
mathematics, nor were philosophers expected to study
engineering. However, with the development of the Internet
and other sources of instantaneous information, many people
strive to gain at least a working knowledge of many different
subjects. So‑called pancake people no longer concentrate their
energies on one area of interest, but instead choose to
spread themselves thinly over a large area. As a result, a
new generation of pancake people have essentially become
the proverbial jacks of all trades, but masters of none.
① new jobs produced by the Internet
② rise of the new generation of artists
③ characteristics of young people’s thinking
④ necessity of instantaneous information sources
⑤ appearance of people with varied but superficial knowledge
34. Bright colored foods frequently seem to taste better than
bland‑looking foods, even when the flavor compounds are
identical. Foods that somehow look off‑color often seem to
have off tastes. For thousands of years, human beings have
relied on visual cues to help determine what is edible. The
color of fruit suggests whether it is ripe; the color of meat
whether it is fresh. Flavor researchers sometimes use
colored lights to modify the influence of visual cues during taste
tests. During one experiment in the early 1970s, people were
served an oddly colored meal of steak and French fries that
appeared normal beneath colored lights. Everyone thought
that the meal tasted fine until the lighting was changed.
Once it became apparent that the steak was actually blue
and the fries were green, some people became ill.
① effect of color of food on taste perception
② ways to improve the taste of food
③ difficulty of preserving food
④ growing popularity of food decoration
⑤ factors influencing the nutritional value of food

The above graph shows how tuition fees and dorm and
board costs for full‑time college students changed over the
last 30 years. ① Over the period, both college tuition fees
and dorm and board costs for full‑time students went up
steadily. ② Of all the periods, the 1978‑1979 period was the
only one when college students paid more for their dorm and
board costs than for their tuition fees. ③ During the
1988‑1989 period, tuition fees surpassed dorm and board
costs for the first time and the former cost more than the
latter thereafter. ④ The tuition fees of the 2008‑2009 period
were more than twice those of the 1993‑1994 period. ⑤ The
gap between tuition fees and dorm and board costs was the
biggest during the 2008‑2009 period.
36. pilum에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The pilum was a heavy spear, used for thrusting or
throwing by Roman soldiers. It had a leaf‑shaped iron head,
60 to 90 centimeters long, embedded in or socketed onto a
wooden shaft with a short iron spike at the rear. Its length
seems to have been around 163 centimeters, although
examples as long as 274 centimeters were found in the
excavation of a swamp site in Illerup, Denmark. Roman
armies were the only ones who used the pilum, which may
mean there were strict regulations on its manufacture and
trade. During the second century A.D. there was a decline in
the use of the pilum, but in the third and fourth centuries it
regained its popularity and was used against the early
barbarian invaders.
① 가벼워서 쉽게 던질 수 있었다.

37. FMD에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Foot‑and‑Mouth Disease(FMD) is a highly contagious
disease caused by a virus. It is almost exclusive to cattle,
sheep, swine, goats, and other cloven‑hoofed animals. Among
its symptoms are fever, loss of appetite and weight, and
blisters on the tongue, lips, other tissues of the mouth, and
the feet. The disease is readily spread by contact; by
contaminated food or water; or through the air. Humans, who
seldom contract the disease, may be carriers, as may rats,
dogs, birds, and wild animals. Complete disposal of infected
animals and disinfection of contaminated material are
prescribed to limit contagion. No effective treatment exists;
vaccines control epidemics but have not eliminated them.
 * cloven‑hoofed: 발굽이 갈라진
① 바이러스에 의해 유발되며 전염성이 강하다.
② 감염시 체중 감소 증상이 나타나기도 한다.
③ 공기를 통해 전염되기도 한다.
④ 사람에 의해서는 전파되지 않는다.
⑤ 현재 효과적인 치료법은 존재하지 않는다.
38. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
I packed the few things that I possessed, and I set out on
a journey westward to my uncle’s. I mourned both for my
mother and the world I was leaving behind. Before I
disappeared behind the hills, I turned and looked at my
village for the last time. I could see the simple huts and the
people going about their chores; the stream where I had
splashed and played with the other boys; the maize fields
and green pastures where the herds and flocks were lazily
grazing. Above all else, my eyes rested on the simple hut
where I had enjoyed my mother’s love. It was this hut that
I associated with all my happiness, with life itself, and I
rued the fact that I had not kissed it before I left.
① sad and sorry ② moved and happy
③ upset and nervous ④ shocked and scared
⑤ bored and depressed

39. Consider a fascinating study by a major French food
manufacturer testing two different containers for a diet
mayonnaise product aimed at female shoppers. Both
containers held the exact same mayonnaise and bore the
exact same label. The only difference was the shapes of the
bottles. The first was narrow around the middle, and thicker
at the top and on the bottom. The second had a slender neck
but a fat, round bottom, like a genie bottle. When asked
which product they preferred, every single subject ― all
diet‑conscious females ― selected the first bottle without
even having tasted the stuff. Why? The researchers
concluded that the subjects were associating the shape of the
bottle with an image of their own bodies.

④ 광고매체에 따라 광고의 형식과 내용도 달라져야 한다.
⑤ 소비자들은 결국 상표에 의해 형성된 이미지를 구매한다.
40. The motor of our ingenuity is the question “Does it have
to be like this?”, from which arise political reforms,
scientific developments, improved relationships, and better
books. The Romans hated winter cold and developed
under‑floor heating. They didn’t wish to walk on muddy
roads, so they paved them. They didn’t want to suffer the
frustration of a shallow public baths, so they drew water
through mountains and across valleys in a system of
aqueducts and underground pipes. The Chinese didn’t want to
find their sailors lost on the sea, so they invented a
compass to help them. They were unhappy when the sailing
ship could only move when the wind blew from behind them,
so they invented sails that allowed ships to sail against the
wind. There would be few great human achievements if we
accepted all our frustrations. * aqueduct: 수로(水路)

41. The forbidding sands of the Sahara might seem an unusual
place for farming. But if you’re farming silicon to make solar
panels, the conditions in the Sahara are more or less
optimal. At least, that’s the thinking behind the Sahara Solar
Breeder Project. The plan, a joint project proposed by
Japanese and Algerian universities, would use the desert’s
immense supplies of sunlight and sand to “breed” solar
power plants and solar panel factories. The idea is to start
with a small number of silicon manufacturing plants that will
produce the silicon needed to manufacture solar panels. Once
those panels are operating, they can be used to power the
silicon plants, which in turn produce more silicon and solar
panels. The universities envision breeding enough silicon and
solar panels by 2050 to supply half the world’s energy.
① Benefits of Industry‑University Cooperation
② A Plan Turns Desert into Energy Farm
③ Tourists Come into the Sahara for Solitude
④ Power Shortage Worsens in North Africa

42. A tree seems to be vulnerable in many aspects. Its overall
architectural and biological design would seem to doom it from
the start. A narrow trunk topped by a gigantic sail made of
leaves would seem to make it a structure destined to fall over
in even a modest wind. The distance between the roots, which
gather the water, and the leaves, which transform that water
via photosynthesis, is a long, gravity‑defying journey ―in some
cases a trip exceeding the length of a football field. Their
initial growth, a very slow pace compared with the shrubs and
weeds around them, would seem to set up a battle for sunlight
and water they could never win. Yet, trees have not only
survived but thrived.
① Various Uses of Trees
② A Tree: An Amazing Thing
③ Why Tree Species Are Decreasing
④ Trees: An Indicator of Earth’s Health
⑤ How Trees Communicate with Each Other

Anthropologist Brain Hare has done experiments with
dogs, where he puts a piece of food under one of two
cups, placed several feet apart. The dog knows that there
is food to be had, but has no idea which of the cups
holds the prize.
(A) This difference is in their cooperations with humans.
Hare explains that primates are very good at using the
cues of the same species. But they are not good at
using human cues when you are trying to cooperate
with them.
(B) In contrast, dogs pay attention to humans, when humans
are doing something very human. Dogs aren’t smarter
than chimps, but they just have a different attitude
toward people, and they are really interested in humans.
(C) Then, Hare points at the right cup, taps on it, and looks
directly at it. What happens? The dog goes to the right
cup virtually every time. Yet when Hare did the same
experiment with chimpanzees, the chimps couldn’t get it
right. A dog will look at you for help, and a chimp
won’t.

Some consumers still remain loyal to the brand‑name
drug, perhaps out of fear that the new generic drugs are
not actually the same as the drug they have been using
for years.
When a firm discovers a new drug, patent laws give the
firm a monopoly on the sale of that drug. ( ① ) During the
life of the patent, the monopoly firm maximizes profit by
controlling the quantity and the price. ( ② ) But eventually
when the patent on a drug expires, other companies quickly
enter the market and begin selling so‑called generic products
that are chemically identical to the former monopolist’s
brand‑name product. ( ③ ) And expectedly, the price of the
competitively produced generic drug is well below the price
that the monopolist was charging. ( ④ ) The expiration of
a patent, however, does not cause the monopolist to lose all
its market power. ( ⑤ )　As a result, the former monopolist
can continue to charge a price at least somewhat above the
price charged by its new competitors.

Architects are usually rewarded according to the
uniqueness of their work. But an architect intent on being
different may in the end prove as troubling as an
over‑imaginative pilot or doctor. However important
originality may be, adherence to familiar form emerges as
the more significant virtue in architecture. We rarely wish
to be surprised by novelty as we go round street corners.
We require consistency in our buildings, for there is
already too much confusion around us. We need the
discipline offered by similarity, just as children need
regular bedtimes and familiar foods. We require that our
buildings act as guardians of composure when we are in
them. The architects who benefit us most may be those
generous enough to lay aside their claims to genius. They
will devote themselves to designing graceful but unoriginal
buildings, where we will not feel disoriented.
󰀻
Architects should try to offer people calmness coming
from (A) rather than focus on the (B) of
their work.

② familiarity ······ profits
③ safety ······ popularity

[46 ~ 48] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
Sen no Rikyu was the most famous tea master of all in
Japan. He was famous for his remarkable ability to
harmonize himself with his guests’ thoughts and to think
one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting to their
taste. Once, another great 16th‑century Japanese tea
master Takeno Sho‑o passed by a house. (a) He noticed
a young man watering flowers near his front gate. Two
things caught Sho‑o’s attention — first, the graceful way
the man performed his task; second, the beautiful rose of
Sharon blossoms that bloomed in the garden.
(B)
Now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the gate
he stopped himself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu’s
tea room. Immediately inside, (b) he stopped in his
tracks and gazed in astonishment: Before him a vase
hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single
rose of Sharon blossom, the most beautiful one in the
garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu , and
with this one eloquent gesture, had demonstrated that
this day’s guest and host would be in perfect harmony.
(C)
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer — he watched
those around him acutely, understanding the subtle
gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then producing that
desire’s image. Although Sho‑o never spoke of being
enchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it
in his eye. (c) He knew that studying people’s eyes was a
surer barometer of pain and pleasure than any spoken
word.
(D)
He stopped and introduced himself to the man, whose
name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho‑o wanted to stay, but had
to hurry off for a prior engagement. Before Sho‑o left,
however, Rikyu invited him to take tea with him the next
morning. Sho‑o happily accepted. When Sho‑o opened the
garden gate the next day, (d) he was horrified to see not
a single flower remained. More than anything else, he
had come there to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that
(e) he had not had the time to appreciate the day before.

Most managers want huge results with little risk. It just
doesn’t work that way. You’ve got to encourage risk
taking without penalty. Human beings by nature hate to
lose. We’re willing to take risks when there’s little
downside, especially if we can see a huge potential
upside. But when things are going fine, we shy away
from taking risks. Not a good idea! In a corporation, too
often it’s one foul and you’re benched. But in the NBA,
every player is allowed six fouls per game. Company
managers and executives should establish a six‑foul rule,
and make it known to everyone.
Think about how some of the most successful coaches
in the NBA view fouls. If LeBron and Kobe end the game
with zero fouls, you know they’re not playing their best
game. If they end the game with five fouls, they’ve
pushed it to the limit and chances are they’ve scored
more points, gotten more rebounds, and gotten more
steals. Once in a while, you foul out. That’s part of the
game. Winners know one thing all too well: You’re not
going to win every game. Let your players get their
fouls. Innovations will come faster, sales will be higher,
and you’ll learn from failure.
Remember the traditional path is , but it will
produce average results, average market share, and
average profits. Unless you climb a mountain, you may
never know what you missed.

Lantin decided on a necklace which had been one of his
wife’s favorites. ① It must be worth at least seven or eight
francs he thought, because for an imitation piece the
workmanship was very good. He put it in his pocket and went
looking for a reliable-looking jeweler. At length he saw
② one and went in, a little ashamed of selling something so
worthless. “Monsieur,” he said to the dealer, “I’d like you to
value ③ this piece for me if you’d be so kind.” The man took
④ the article, examined it, turned it over, weighed it, and took
up a magnifying glass to look at it more closely. Lantin was a
little embarrassed by all this ceremony and was about to say,
“Look, I’m pretty sure it’s got no value at all,” when the
jeweler announced: “Monsieur, I’d put it at between 12,000
and 15,000 francs. However, I could not purchase ⑤ this from
you without knowing its exact provenance.”

When induced to give spoken or written witness to
something they doubt, people will often feel bad about their
deceit. Nevertheless, they begin to believe (A) what / that they
are saying. When there is no compelling external explanation
for one’s words, saying becomes believing. Tory Higgins and
his colleagues had university students read a personality
description of someone and then (B) summarize / summarized
it for someone else who was believed either to like or to dislike
this person. The students wrote a more positive description
when the recipient liked the person. Having said positive
things, they also then liked the person more themselves.
(C) Asked / Asking to recall what they had read, they remembered
the description as being more positive than it was. In short, it
seems that we are prone to adjust our messages to our listeners,
and, having done so, to believe the altered message.

We want to stop watching so much TV, but demonstrably,
we also want to watch lots of TV. So what we really want, it
seems, ① is to stop wanting. We ② are trapped deep in a
paradox: deciding on the best course of action, then doing
something else. The way around this is ③ to see that habits
are responses to needs. This sounds ④ obvious, but countless
efforts at habit change ignore its implications. If you eat
badly, you might resolve to start eating well. However, if you
are eating burgers and ice-cream to feel comforted, relaxed
and happy, ⑤ try to replace them with broccoli and carrot
juice is like dealing with a leaky bathroom tap by repainting
the kitchen. What is required is not a better diet, but an
alternative way to feel comforted and relaxed.

A way to get things done more efficiently and get better
results is to do the right thing at the right time of day. Know
your own body rhythm, respect your internal clock, and pay
attention to how your energy level ebbs and flows during the
day. If you have lots of energy early in the morning, that is
when you should schedule difficult activities, whether for you
these are brainstorming, writing, or practicing. Use the same
principle in planning activities for your team. Schedule
intervals of productive time and breaks so that you get the most
from people. I always ask people to respect their own body
rhythms when scheduling appointments. In my experience,
most people are far more productive in the morning, but there
are those who differ and hit their stride later in the day.
① 업무 성과를 높이기 위해 오후 근무시간을 늘려라.

Since the 1980’s, zoos have strived to reproduce the natural
habitats of their animals, replacing concrete floors and steel
bars with grass, rocks, trees, and pools of water. These
environments may simulate the wild, but the animals do not have
to worry about finding food, shelter, or safety from predators.
① While this may not seem like such a bad deal at first glance,
the animals experience numerous complications. ② And yet,
most of the complications were settled with no delay in order to
ensure the animals’ health and safety. ③ The zebras live
constantly in fear, smelling the lions in the nearby Great Cats
exhibit every day and finding themselves unable to escape.
④ There is no possibility of migrating or of storing food for the
winter, which must seem to promise equally certain doom to a
bird or bear. ⑤ In short, zoo life is utterly incompatible with an
animal’s most deeply-rooted survival instincts.
* doom: 파멸, 종말

24. The wrapping of Christmas presents, William Waits notes,
is a fairly recent phenomenon in American life. It arose at the
turn of the 20th century, during a period when hand-made
presents were giving way to machine-made, store-bought
ones. For both givers and manufacturers, this shift presented a
problem, for the machine-made items, precisely because they
were convenient, represented less of the giver’s personal
attention than the hand-made items had done; thus they were
symbolically less intimate. To disguise this loss of symbolic
value, and to invest the manufactured items with a personal
touch, retailers encouraged shoppers to have their purchases
gift-wrapped. Gift-wrapping, in Waits’s acute term, became a
‘decontaminating mechanism’ that removed the presents from
the ‘normal flow of bought-and-sold goods’ and made them,
for a single ceremonial moment, emblems of rather
than commerce.
* emblem: 상징
① intimacy ② disguise ③ generosity
④ convenience ⑤ encouragement
25. Some people tend to be late as a general rule, whether they
are busy or not. To stop being late, all one has to do is change
the motivation by deciding that in all circumstances being
on time is going to have first priority over any other
consideration. Presto! You will never have to run for a plane
or miss an appointment again. As a lifelong latecomer, that is
how I cured myself. Having made the decision that
was now of major importance, I found that answers came
automatically to such questions as “Can I squeeze in one more
errand before the dentist?” or “Do I have to leave for the
airport now?” The answers are always no, and yes. Choosing
to be on time will make your life enormously easier, and that
of your family, friends, and colleagues as well.
① harmony ② precision ③ promptness
④ consistency ⑤ thriftiness

26. The hazards of migration range from storms to starvation,
but they are outweighed by the advantages to be found in the
temporary superabundance of food in the summer home. The
process of evolution ensures that a species migrates only if it
pays it to do so. Birds of the same species may be migratory
in one area, but sedentary elsewhere. Most song thrushes
migrate from northern Scotland; but in the south of England,
the balance of advantage against disadvantage is so delicate
that while some migrate to Spain and Portugal, the majority
normally over winter. Moreover,
England’s winters have been getting warmer since the late
1980’s and if the trend continues it is likely that our song
thrushes will become increasingly sedentary.
* sedentary: 이주하지 않는 ** thrush: [조류] 개똥지빠귀
① suffer from a scarcity of food
② do not lay eggs
③ stay in England
④ fly back to Scotland
⑤ migrate somewhere north of England
27. Some people believe that is some kind
of instinct, developed because it benefits our species in some
way. At first, this seems like a strange idea: Darwin’s theories
of evolution presume that individuals should act to preserve
their own interests, not those of the species as a whole. But
the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins believes
that natural selection has given us the ability to feel pity for
someone who is suffering. When humans lived in small
clan-based groups, a person in need would be a relative or
someone who could pay you back a good turn later, so taking
pity on others could benefit you in the long run. Modern
societies are much less close-knit and when we see a heartfelt
appeal for charity, chances are we may never even meet the
person who is suffering ― but the emotion of pity is still in
our genes. [3점]
① not wanting to suffer ② giving to charity
③ drawing pity from others ④ exploring alternatives
⑤ pursuing individual interests
28. Essentially, your reputation is your most valuable asset ―
so guard it well. But do not be terribly demoralized if you make
some mistakes along the way. With time it is possible to repair
a stained reputation. Every experience you have with someone
else is like a drop of water falling into a pool. As your
experiences with that person grow, the drops accumulate and
the pool deepens. Positive interactions are clear drops of water
and negative interactions are red drops of water. But they
are not equal. That is, , and
that number differs for different people. Those who are very
forgiving only need a few positive experiences ― clear drops
― to dilute a bad experience, while those who are less
forgiving need a lot more to wash away the red. [3점]
① a number of clear drops can dry up with time
② a drop of red water can lead your life to ruin
③ a number of water drops can affect your experience
④ a number of red drops can accumulate gradually
⑤ a number of clear drops can dilute one red drop

29. When you are picking out products in the grocery store,
searching for the best possible strawberry jam, you are trying
to maximize your own enjoyment. You are the only person
that matters; it is your sense of pleasure that you are trying to
please. In this case, (A) is the ideal strategy. You
should listen to those cells in the brain that tell you what you
really want. However, when you are making a moral decision,
this egocentric strategy backfires. Moral decisions require taking
other people into account. You cannot act like a greedy brute
or let your anger get out of control. Doing the right thing
means thinking about (B) , using the emotional
brain to mirror the emotions of strangers. Selfishness needs to
be balanced by some selflessness.
* backfire: 역효과를 낳다
(A) (B)
① selflessness …… your neighbors
② selflessness …… utmost justice
③ self-esteem …… genuine happiness
④ selfishness …… eternal beauty
⑤ selfishness …… everybody else
30. We tend to consider ourselves as rational decision makers,
logically evaluating the costs and benefits of each alternative
we encounter. (A) , we are much more primitive than
most assume. A team of economists looked at how consumers
reacted to various pitches by banks to take out a loan. A
purely rational view would have predicted that interest rates
would be the only factor that had an impact. But the scientists
varied more than just the interest rate; they also tested how
persuasive other approaches might be. (B) , some
letters offered a chance to win a cell phone in a lottery if the
customer came in to inquire about a loan. They found that
such an offer increased loan inquiries by as much as dropping
the interest rate five points. For a $50,000 loan, this meant
some customers were in essence willing to pay $16,000 more
in interest to receive a $100 cell phone.

It is the end of a long, tiring day at Walt Disney World, and a
busload of parents and children are starting the twenty-minute
ride back to their hotel. The children are overstimulated and
annoyed, and so are the parents. Everyone is whiny. It is a bus
ride from hell. Then, rising above the unpleasant buzz of
complaining children and parents, comes a thin, persistent
melody: The bus driver has started to sing the song ‘Under the
Sea’ from the movie The Little Mermaid. Everyone begins to
quiet down and listen. Eventually a little girl joins in, then
several more children. By the end of the ride everyone is
singing ‘The Circle of Life’ from the movie The Lion King.
The bus ride from hell has become the pleasurable, song-filled
end to a full day.

Back in the 1870’s, Sholes & Co., a leading manufacturer of
typewriters at the time, received many (A) complaints /
compliments from users about typewriter keys sticking
together if the operator went too fast. In response, management
asked its engineers to figure out a way to prevent this from
happening. The engineers discussed the problem and then one
of them said, “What if we (B) turned / slowed the operator
down? If we did that, the keys would not jam together nearly
as much.” The result was to have an inefficient keyboard
configuration. For example, the letters ‘O’ and ‘I’ are the third
and sixth most frequently used letters in the English language,
and yet the engineers positioned them on the keyboard so that
the relatively weaker fingers had to depress them. This ‘inefficient

According to Cambodian legends, lions once roamed the

united Cambodia in the 12th century, made his army train in
bokator, turning it into a ④ fearsome fighting force. Despite

34. While in Japan, I ordered green tea with sugar at a
restaurant. A waiter politely explained that one does not drink
green tea with sugar. I responded that I was aware of this
custom but I liked my tea sweet. The waiter took up the issue
with the manager. After a lengthy conversation, the manager
came over and said, “I’m very sorry. We don’t have sugar.”
Disappointed, I changed my order to a cup of coffee, which
the waiter soon brought over. Resting on the saucer were two
packets of sugar. My failure to obtain a cup of sweet green tea
was due to a fundamental difference in our ideas about choice.

35. After a stressful day, how do you wind down and clear your
mind? Relaxing in a comfortable chair, putting on some
soothing sounds, and reading something light and entertaining
are all good methods to get ready for some restful sleep. But as
you ease your exhausted senses, do not forget your sense of
smell. Certain aromas can fill you with feelings of tranquility,
and research has found that lavender, vanilla, and green apple
are among the best smells to help lower anxiety and induce
sleep. You can use essential oils of these scents by applying
them to the back of your neck or the inside of your wrist. Even
better, indulge in a warm bath with these oils dissolved in the
water. Before bed, you might enjoy a glass of hot soy milk with
natural vanilla flavoring for a calming effect inside and out.
① usefulness of aroma for restful sleep
② factors inhibiting good sleep
③ origins of aromatic stress-relievers
④ reasons for stress and fatigue
⑤ ways of extracting various essential oils

37. Guillaume de Machaut에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
Guillaume de Machaut, who was famous as both a musician
and a poet, was born in the French province of Champagne. He
studied theology and spent much of his life in the service of
various royal families. Around 1323, he became secretary and
chaplain to John, king of Bohemia, whom he accompanied on
trips and military campaigns throughout Europe. In his later
years he lived mainly in Reims, where he served as a church
official. Machaut traveled to many courts and presented
beautifully decorated copies of his music and poetry to his
noble patrons. These copies make Machaut one of the first
important composers whose works have survived. The decline
of the church in the fourteenth century is reflected in
Machaut’s output, which consists mainly of courtly love songs
for one to four performers.
① 신학을 공부한 후 일생 동안 평민을 위해 봉사했다.
② 1323년경 Bohemia 왕이 되어 전쟁에 참여하였다.
③ Reims에 사는 동안에는 교회 활동을 하지 않았다.
④ 귀족 후원자들에게 자신의 음악과 시의 사본을 주었다.
⑤ 14세기 교회의 부흥이 그의 작품 속에 반영되어 있다.
38. Bloodhound Car에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
What’s faster than a speeding bullet and isn’t named
Superman? The answer is the Bloodhound Car, or soon will
be. Now being built in England, it is expected to be completed
within a year. Powered by three engines, it is designed to go
1,050 miles per hour (mph), which would blast past the current
land speed record of 763 mph, set in 1997. It is 13 meters long,
1.5 meters wide and 2 meters tall, and weighs 6.4 tons. Due to
its enormous weight, it won’t be the quickest car in the world
from 0 to 100 mph, as it will take 15 seconds. But after that, it
will only take 25 seconds to go from 100 to 1,000 mph! The
Bloodhound Car is scheduled to make its record-breaking
attempt in 2013 at the Hakskeen Pan Desert in South Africa.
① 현재 England에서 제작되고 있다.

39. Here is a surprise for you: Being happy means that you
realize that there are times that you will be unhappy and
recognize that life sometimes stinks. What is uplifting in those
times is appreciating life and facing the challenges that come
with it, realizing that you are facing challenges fellow humans
have also faced. We are not saying you should lower your
expectations for your so-called perfect life or downsize your
goals; we just believe that if you can align your expectations
with reality a little more by expecting to face challenges, you
will be better off in the end. There is an interesting biological
reinforcement for this notion, too: Your levels of C-reactive
protein (a marker of damaging inflammation) have been shown
to be higher when you have expectations that are unattainable.

40. The Greek philosopher Socrates observed, “The unexamined
life is not worth living.” For most people, however, reflection
and self-examination do not come naturally. As much as any
other kind of thinking, reflection requires solitude. Distraction
and reflection simply do not mix. It is not the kind of thing
you can do well near a television, while the phone is ringing,
or with children in the same room. One of the reasons I have
been able to accomplish much and keep growing personally is
that I have not only set aside time to reflect, but I have
separated myself from distractions for short blocks of time:
thirty minutes in the spa; an hour outside on a rock in my
backyard; or a few hours in a comfortable chair in my office.
The place does not matter ⎯ as long as you remove yourself
from distractions and interruptions.

41. Virtuoso violinist Pinchas Zukerman was giving a master
class to a group of young artists who had come to the Aspen
Music Festival from all over the world. The auditorium was
filled with aspiring artists, distinguished teachers, and
well-known performers; the atmosphere was competitive and
electric. As each performer played, Zukerman offered friendly
advice and encouragement, invariably picking up his own
violin to demonstrate finer points of technique. The last
musician performed brilliantly. When the applause subsided,
Zukerman complimented the artist, then picked up his own
violin, tucked it under his chin, paused a long moment, and
then, without playing a note or uttering a word, he placed the
instrument back in its case. The audience responded with
deafening applause, in recognition of this master musician
who could pay so gracious a compliment.

42. Whenever you stand on a scale in your bathroom or place a
melon on a scale at the grocery store, you are measuring
weight. An object’s weight is the force exerted on it by
gravity, usually the earth’s gravity. When you stand on a
bathroom scale, the scale measures just how much upward
force it must exert on you in order to keep you from moving
downward toward the earth’s center. As in most scales you will
encounter, the bathroom scale uses a spring to provide this
upward support. If you are stationary, you are not accelerating,
so your downward weight and the upward force from the
spring must cancel one another; that is, they must be equal in
magnitude but opposite in direction so that they sum to zero
net force.

A few years ago we purchased a brand-new camper van.
Not long after we bought our camper, a friend of ours
asked if her family could borrow it. We were not too
interested in loaning out our spotless camper, so we
declined.
(A) That in itself would not have been so bad had it not been
for the mice. Mice were attracted by the food and they
shredded all the curtains, screens, and cushions. Had we
let the friend borrow the camper, she would have
discovered the boxes before the mice did.
(B) This happened in the fall, and we stored the camper in our
backyard all that winter. In the spring my husband and I
were setting it up to prepare for a trip.
(C) We were very surprised to find that we had left cookie
boxes in the camper over the winter. We had moved and
had a baby that previous summer and fall, and cleaning
out the camper had been overlooked.

But when ice forms, they can walk out to a hole near
where the seals are swimming, then sit and wait for a seal
to pop its head up to breathe.
Across the Arctic, polar bear numbers are in decline. If the
climate continues to warm at the current rate, the bears could
disappear completely in the next hundred years. ( ① ) But
for now, if you visit Churchill, Canada in October or
November, it’s almost a sure thing you’ll see a polar bear in
the wild. ( ② ) Churchill, population 914, sits on the edge of
Hudson Bay at the point where the ice first forms every
winter. And these bears love ice. ( ③ ) Their fondness for
frozen seas is simple: Ice means they can eat their favorite
meal ― seals. ( ④ ) Although polar bears are powerful
marine mammals, able to swim a hundred miles or more
nonstop, they’re too slow to catch a seal in open water. ( ⑤ )
Or as a bear might put it, “Dinner is served.”

Behavioral evidence for separate types of taste receptors
comes from studies of the following type: Soak your tongue
for 15 seconds in a sour solution, such as unsweetened
lemon juice. Then try tasting some other sour solution, such
as dilute vinegar. You will find that the second solution
tastes less sour than usual. Depending on the concentrations
of the lemon juice and vinegar, the second solution may not
taste sour at all. This phenomenon, called adaptation,
reflects the fatigue of receptors sensitive to sour tastes.
Now try tasting something salty, sweet, or bitter. These
substances taste about the same as usual. In short, you
experience little cross-adaptation ― reduced response to
one taste after exposure to another. Evidently, the sour
receptors are different from the other taste receptors.
Similarly, you can show that salt receptors are different
from the others and so forth.
The fact that the intensity of a taste is (A) after trying
the same taste, but not after trying a different taste, serves
as evidence for the existence of (B) receptors for
different tastes.
(A) (B)
① increased …… adaptive
② increased …… identical
③ measured …… sensitive
④ decreased …… distinct
⑤ decreased …… collective

My sister, Tara, was the quiet one in the family. She was
not as adventurous as my brother and I. She never excelled at
school or sports. Of course, I loved my sister, but, at times,
that was not so easy to do. She seldom made eye contact
with me. When we ran into each other at school, (a) she
sometimes pretended not to recognize me.
One day, my father’s job forced us to move to a new
neighborhood. The nurse at our new school, Emerson, gave
us ear and eye exams, our first ever. I aced the tests ― “Eagle
eyes and elephant ears,” the nurse said ― but Tara struggled
to read the eye chart. (b) She declared Tara severely
shortsighted and she had to get glasses. When the glasses
were ready, we all went downtown to pick them up. The first
time she tried them on, she kept moving her head around and
up and down. “What’s the matter?” I asked. “You can see that
tree over there?” she said, pointing at a sycamore tree about a
hundred feet away. I nodded. (c) She sobbed, “I can see not
just the branches, but each little leaf.” Tara burst into tears.
On the way home, she kept seeing for the first time all
these things that most everyone else had stopped noticing.
She read street signs and billboards aloud. She pointed out
sparrows sitting on the telephone wires. At home, Tara
insisted that I try on her glasses. I put them on, and the world
turned into fuzzy, unfocused shapes. I took a few steps and
banged my knee on the coffee table. It was at that very
moment that I truly understood Tara for the first time. I
realized why (d) she did not like to go exploring, or why she
did not recognize me at school.
Tara loved seeing the world clearly. Not long after she got
her glasses, she decided she wanted to be an artist. She
started compulsively drawing and painting all the wondrous
things she was discovering. (e) Her first painting of the
sycamore tree is still her favorite. Today, she is an art teacher
at Emerson, where she tries to bring the best out of each
individual student.

(A)
I observe the moon wherever I go. What phase is it in, I
wonder? When will it reach the full moon phase? Now
imagine what happened to me recently when I was teaching
in Australia, 12,000 miles from my hometown in North
America. Shortly after my arrival, seeing that the skies were
cloudy, I checked the newspaper for a weather report.
Typically, the weather page also gives times for sunrise and
sunset as well as moonrise and moonset.
(B)
Picture my surprise when I discovered that the illustrations
in the newspaper were, by my experience, wrong. The
waxing moon appeared to be illuminated on the left side
rather than the right side as I had always known it to be. “I
must call the newspaper,” I thought. But I continued to study
the images in the newspaper and then consulted a globe.
* wax: (점점) 커지다
(C)
The point is that often we do not see things as they are.
Instead, we see things as we are. That is why it is necessary
in science to have many people making many observations
of the same phenomenon. I am sure that to people in
Australia, .
(D)
When I imagined myself standing on a spot in the southern
hemisphere, the answer came to me. Here, indeed, south of
the equator, the waxing moon appears to be on the left. Try
this in your imagination, and you will see it, too.

So, you’re ready to add a new member, a furry one, to
your family. But now you have one more decision to
make: What kind of dog should I get? Here are some tips
to consider when choosing a dog that is right for you.
First, pick a dog that fits your home. Bring a big one into
your house only if you can give him a lot of space.
Second, don’t buy a shaggy dog if you’re allergic. Getting
a non-shedding dog is a good idea if you’re worried about
loose hairs or your kids’ allergies. Third, pick a
mild-mannered puppy that is likely to be more forgiving
and protective of his little owners. Keep these in mind,
and you’ll enjoy having the new member at home.

fieldworker, describes the early stages of fieldwork as ‘a strange,

Albert Einstein sought relentlessly for a so-called unified
field theory ― a theory capable of describing nature’s forces
within a single, all-encompassing, coherent framework. ①
Einstein was not motivated by the things we often associate
with scientific undertakings, such as trying to explain this or
that piece of experimental data. ② Instead, he was driven by
a passionate belief that the deepest understanding of the
universe would reveal its truest wonder: the simplicity and
power of the principles on which it is based. ③ As in
Einstein’s formulation, the two theories underlying the
tremendous progress of physics were mutually incompatible.
④ Einstein wanted to illuminate the workings of the
universe with a clarity never before achieved, allowing us
all to stand in awe of its sheer beauty and elegance. ⑤ In
his day, however, Einstein never realized this dream, mainly
because a number of essential features of matter and the
forces of nature were either unknown or, at best, poorly
understood.

Effective leaders set the tone for the entire organization.
It’s not a matter of knowing more than everyone else. There
are plenty of leaders who are not the biggest experts in their
companies. But it does mean working hard, something anyone
can do. Be the first person to arrive at the workplace and be
the last one to leave. If you can do that, you will already be
light years ahead of most managers in the respect you will
gain from your team members. Apply the same principle to all
your routine activities. If you expect your sales force to make
50 calls each day, make 100 calls yourself. It is not rocket
science. It is just basic ‘lead by example’ management. No
one can really discredit leaders who are the hardest-working
individuals in their organizations.

24. Science is making the future, and nations are busy
making future scientists. The more science that emerges
from this investment, the greater the need for us to follow
the gist of the science with sufficient understanding. In
other words, if we the ordinary people are to keep pace
with science, we need more science writers, and more
science writing that is clear, wise and eloquent, and that
demands to be read. People often feel excluded from
science, convinced that it takes an advanced degree to
understand what scientists do. As a result, they defensively
shrug off the whole business as an exclusive realm of little
relevance to their lives. One of the surest cures for
scientific is great scientific literature,
writing that does not merely translate technical terms into
plain English or explain complicated ideas simply.

five-page essay on the subject of why the Roman Empire
fell, most of them are likely to say it was a combination
of economic and social causes ultimately leading to a
weakening of the frontiers. This would be a fine answer,
but after reading forty-five papers all saying the same
thing, I’m ready for a change. If you can take a different
angle from the rest of the class in a paper, you’re more
likely to impress your professors. But here’s the tricky
part ― being different is risky, and it only works if you
back up your argument very well. If you choose to argue
that Rome fell solely because Christianity weakened the
fighting spirit of the Romans, you will need persuasive
reasoning and arguments against any potential objections.
① Variety is the spice of life
② The essence of writing is in its brevity
③ Don’t fix what is not broken
④ The pen is mightier than the sword
⑤ Rome was not built in a day
26. Consumers of different age groups obviously have very
different needs and wants. Although people who belong to
the same age group differ in many other ways, they do tend
to share a set of values and common cultural experiences
that they carry throughout life. In some cases, marketers
initially develop a product to attract one age group and then
try to . That is what the
high-octane energy drink Reddox does. The company
aggressively introduced it in bars, nightclubs, and gyms to
the product’s core audience of young people. Over time, it
became popular in other contexts, and the company began
to sponsor the PGA European Tour to expand its reach to
older golfers. It also hands out free cans to commuters, cab
drivers, and car rental agencies to promote the drink as a
way to stay alert on the road. [3점]

27. is aggravated by the
overabundance of information at our disposal. While this
is obvious enough in some realms ― for example,
consider how much information is potentially relevant for
estimating the value of Microsoft stock ― even when the
information set seems less cluttered, information overload,
a state of confusion and decision avoidance, can still
occur. In one experiment, shoppers in a supermarket
were presented with free samples of jams and jellies. In
the first treatment, a small selection was available for
tasting; in the second, a large selection was available.
While everyone likes the idea of abundant choice, and
indeed the table with the greater selection attracted larger
crowds, it was the table with fewer samples that led to
the most sales. The likely reason is that the large
selection led to information overload, the feeling that the
decision was too complicated for immediate action.
① Difficulty in assessing information
② The shortage of trustworthy informants
③ Mental fatigue caused by misleading information
④ Indeterminacy arising from indirect information
⑤ The complexity of altering consumer behavior
28. The essence of science is to uncover patterns and
regularities in nature by finding algorithmic compressions
of observations. But the raw data of observation rarely
exhibit explicit regularities. Instead we find that nature’s
order is hidden from us, it is written in code. To make
progress in science we need to crack the cosmic code, to
dig beneath the raw data and uncover the hidden order. I
often liken fundamental science to doing a crossword
puzzle. Experiment and observation provide us with
clues, but the clues are cryptic, and require some
considerable ingenuity to solve. With each new solution,
. As with a crossword, so
with the physical universe, we find that the solutions to
independent clues link together in a consistent and
supportive way to form a coherent unity, so that the
more clues we solve, the easier we find it to fill in the
missing features. [3점]

34. Some species seem to have a stronger influence than others
on their ecosystem. Take away the sea stars along the northwest
coast of the United States, for instance, and the ecosystem
changes dramatically; in the absence of these sea stars, their
favorite prey, mussels, takes over and makes it hard for other
species that used to live there. Sea stars are known as
keystone species, because as top predators they determine
ecosystem structure by their eating habits. If you chop down
an aspen tree by a beaver pond, not much will happen; but if
you take away a beaver, a wetland might dry out, changing
the kinds of plants that live there and the animals that rely on
them. Because beavers exert their influence by physically
altering the landscape, they are known as ecosystem engineers.

35. Despite the fact that ancient civilizations relied upon the
apparent motion of celestial bodies through the sky to
determine seasons, months, and years, we know little about
the details of timekeeping in prehistoric eras. But wherever
we turn up records and artifacts, we usually discover that in
every culture, some people were preoccupied with measuring
the passage of time. Ice-age hunters in Europe over 20,000
years ago scratched lines and made holes in sticks and
bones, possibly counting the days between phases of the
moon. Five thousand years ago, Sumerians in the
Tigris-Euphrates valley had a calendar that divided the year
into 30 day months, and the day into 12 periods. We have
no written records of Stonehenge, built over 4,000 years ago
in England, but its alignments show its purposes apparently
included the determination of seasonal or celestial events.

The church ‘Sveta Bogoroditsa’ (‘Holy Virgin’) in
Karlovo has a handsome profile with its blue and white
bell tower. The bell tower is relatively new, from 1897, but
the church building, as the inscription above the western
entrance tells us, dates from 1851. Before they began
constructing this new building in 1847, the older church of
the Holy Virgin had burned down in 1813. This latter
church, about which little is known, is believed by some to
have been built already at the end of the fifteenth century,
at the time of the founding of the little town of Karli-ova,
later Karlovo. In any case, the names of priests serving in
the church have been preserved from the eighteenth century
on. Although the construction was completed in 1851, the
events of the Crimean War and lack of funds delayed the
furnishing of the church, and its consecration did not take
place until May 20, 1858.

Edwin Armstrong, who first discovered and developed FM
radio in the 1920s and early 1930s, is often considered the
most prolific and influential inventor in radio history. He
alone understood the impact of De Forest’s vacuum tube, and
he used it to invent an amplifying system that enabled radio
receivers to pick up distant signals. Armstrong’s innovations
rendered useless the enormous alternators used for generating
power in early radio transmitters. In 1922, he sold a ‘super’
version of his circuit to Radio Corporation of America (RCA)
for $200,000 and sixty thousand shares of RCA stock,
making him a millionaire as well as RCA’s largest private
stockholder. Armstrong also worked on the major problem of
radio reception ― electrical interference. Between 1930 and
1933, the inventor filed five patents on FM.

39. Despite what you might think, luck isn’t a matter of fate
or destiny, according to research by psychologist Richard
Wiseman. Instead, it’s a result of the way lucky people
think and act ― which means that anyone can learn to be
lucky! For instance, Wiseman found that lucky people
always take notice of what’s going on around them and stay
open to new experiences and opportunities. Meanwhile,
unlucky people tend to be tenser and too focused on certain
tasks, which stops them from noticing opportunities they
aren’t explicitly looking for. So, next time you’re heading
to a party, don’t go in with a goal in mind (no matter how
much you want to attract someone). Instead, take things as
they come and you never know what might happen. You
could even make some awesome new friends.

Aronoff, participants were asked to negotiate with a seller
over the purchase price of a piece of art. Toward the end
of the negotiation, the seller made a final offer in one of
two ways. Half of the time he said that he would accept
$6,000, while the other half of the time he gave the same
final price but also added a little humor (“Well, my final
offer is $6,000, and I’ll throw in my pet frog”). Those few
moments of attempted humor had a large effect, as
participants made a much greater compromise in their
purchase price when they heard about the frog. It seemed
that the brief humorous comment momentarily put the
participants in a good mood and encouraged them to be
more giving.

41. The green revolution was a mixed blessing. Over time
farmers came to rely heavily on broadly adapted, high-yield
crops to the exclusion of varieties adapted to local
conditions. Monocropping vast fields with the same
genetically uniform seeds helps boost yield and meet
immediate hunger needs. Yet high-yield varieties are also
genetically weaker crops that require expensive chemical
fertilizers and toxic pesticides. The same holds true for
high-yield livestock breeds, which often require expensive
feed and medicinal care to survive in foreign climates. The
drive to increase production is pushing out local varieties,
diluting livestock’s genetic diversity in the process. As a
result, the world’s food supply has become largely
dependent on a shrinking list of breeds designed for
maximum yield. In short, in our focus on increasing the
amount of food we produce today, we have accidentally put
ourselves at risk for food shortages in the future.

42. About twenty years ago, Time magazine described a
study by a psychologist of people who had lost their jobs
three times due to plant closings. The writers were amazed
by what they discovered. They expected the people being
laid off to be beaten down and discouraged. Instead they
found them to be incredibly resilient. Why was that? They
concluded that people who had weathered repeated
adversity had learned to bounce back. People who had lost
a job and found a new one twice before were much better
prepared to deal with adversity than someone who had
always worked at the same place and had never faced
adversity. It may sound ironic, but if you have experienced
a lot of failure, you are actually in a better position to
achieve success than people who have not.

One reason why the definitions of words have
changed over time is simply because of their misuse.
There are a growing number of examples where the
incorrect meaning of relatively commonplace language
has become more widespread than the original intention
or definition.
(A) Now, imagine that an angry customer sent you a letter
about the service he received in one of your stores. If
your reply is that you ‘perused his letter,’ he is likely
to get even more angry than he was before.
(B) The word ‘peruse’ is one of them. Most people think
that to ‘peruse’ something means to ‘scan or skim it
quickly, without paying much attention.’ In fact, this is
the exact opposite of what ‘peruse’ really means: ‘to
study or read something carefully, in detail.’
(C) But the word has been misused so often by so many
people, that this second sense of it ― the exact
opposite of what it actually means ― has finally been
accepted as a secondary definition and as far as most
people know, it is the only definition.

The smartest of our deep ancestors would have stored

Evolutionary psychologists have suggested that the

savannah and you strike it lucky. ( ① ) You come
across a huge beast and you manage to kill it. ( ② ) It
yields far more meat than anyone involved in the hunt or
their families can possibly consume. ( ③ ) How do you
get the most benefit of your excess meat without a fridge,

from your gift could possibly repay your generosity in the

meat. ( ⑤ ) Groups of early humans who developed
stable relationships and practiced this sort of mutual
altruism were in a better position to prosper and multiply.

A bumper sticker reading “Don’t Believe Everything
You Think” is placed on the edge of the whiteboard in
Greene’s office. It represents the underlying message of
the book he is writing. An analogy carried throughout
the book compares the moral brain to a camera with
automatic settings for taking a picture of a mountain or
an indoor portrait or a close-up of a flower, and manual
settings for unusual conditions or when we want a
nonstandard artistic effect. Greene believes emotions and
intuitions are the auto settings for our morality while
reasoning is the manual mode.
We need our intuitions to make the millions of quick
judgments that fill our lives from day to day or else we
could not function. But they are not always trustworthy
moral indicators, since they were set to handle problems
deep in our evolutionary past and are often useless for
the newer complexities of the modern world. We need to
rely on our manual settings, the reasoning sections of our
brain, for more complex or novel situations, Greene says.

emotions and intuitions make our lives easier in making
(A) decisions, but we need to rely on (B)
for more complex problems.

(A)
I grew up in a small town in northern California,
between wide-open ranchland and dark forests, feeling at
home in two places: the wild land and books. I read
constantly, hungrily, and without direction, collecting a
strange stew of facts and ideas about the rest of the
world. I longed for a world away from what I knew
and outrageously outside my means.
(B)
The important lesson I learned at (a) Billups ― the world
was a lot bigger than I had imagined it to be ― was a little
painful. It meant I was a lot smaller than I’d realized. I
went on to attend a state university and I began to write
about my disappearing dreams and new dreams, about
wishing and disappointment and feeling small. One day a
professor (b) there took hold of me and said, “You’re a
writer.” Until then, I hadn’t really known. I had to figure
out who I was not going to be before I could get on to
who I was. The lesson from Billups lay below the surface,
but when I began to write, it rose like flowers and bloomed
into words and stories and books, and me.
(C)
One morning I came across a catalog for a college
preparatory school called Billups Academy. (c) It had a
summer program and offered scholarships for high
school students to ‘deepen and extend their intellectual,
aesthetic, and moral interests.’ I applied for and won a
scholarship. Billups wasn’t just another school ― it was
another world. I was used to big skies, wild water,
snakes and horses, and solitude. What waited for me in
(d) this new world was tree-lined avenues, brick
buildings with white pillars, and a wood-paneled library.
(D)
Unlike back at home, in (e) the new school, I was no
longer the smartest kid in the classroom. I wasn’t the most
talented, or the least. Before going to Billups, one of my
dreams was to become a photographer. That dream came to
an abrupt halt in a photography class. There was no
denying in the other students’ pictures that they were far
more talented than I was. I became severely depressed as
one dream after another faded from me. Then, on the last
night of the summer program, it hit me. I had been blind
to a lesson that was staring at me in the face.

The McDonald’s restaurants that are located across the
United States ― and, increasingly, the world ― have a
significance that goes far beyond the convenience of quick
hamburgers, milk shakes, and salads. As sociologist George
Ritzer says, our everyday lives are being ‘McDonaldized.’
The McDonaldization of society does not refer just to
the robotlike assembly of food. This term refers to the
standardization of everyday life, a process that is transforming
our lives. Want to do some shopping? Shopping malls offer
one-stop shopping in controlled environments. Planning a
trip? Travel agencies offer ‘package’ tours. They will
transport middle-class Americans to ten European capitals
in fourteen days. All visitors experience the same hotels,
restaurants, and other scheduled sites.
Efficiency brings dependability. You can expect your
burger and fries to taste the same whether you buy them
in Los Angeles or Beijing. Although efficiency also lowers
prices, it does come at a cost. Predictability washes away
spontaneity, changing the quality of our lives. It produces
a sameness, a bland version of what used to be unique
experiences. In my own travels, for example, had I taken
packaged tours I never would have had the eye-opening
experiences that have added so much to my appreciation of
human diversity. For good or bad, our lives are being
McDonaldized, and the predictability of packaged settings
seems to be our social destiny. Our coming prepackaged
society will be , of course. But it also means
that we will be trapped in the ‘iron cage’ of bureaucracy
― just as Weber warned would happen.

Researchers studied two mobile phone companies trying

The boundaries among business units were deliberately

During the 1997 Kyoto negotiations, Brazil made a
suggestion that has since become known as the Brazilian
Proposal. ① Its idea was that countries should now share
the burden of emissions cuts according to how historically
responsible they were for the problem. ② In other words,
we should calculate what concentration of greenhouse
gases each country has put into the atmosphere over time
and use those figures to allocate emissions cuts. ③ That
would mean, for instance, that countries such as Germany
and the United Kingdom, which have been emitting for
longer than most countries, would bear a larger share
than their current emissions implied. ④ Greenhouse gases
have been known to absorb heat and hold this heat in the
atmosphere, instead of reflecting it back into space. ⑤ It
would also mean that big emitters that had developed
their industries more recently, such as Australia, would
bear less of a share.

Many people use their cleverness to justify and excuse
themselves for the messiness of their workspaces. They
say things like, “I know where everything is.” Or they
say non-humorous things such as, “A clean desk is a
sign of a sick mind.” However, people who say they
know where everything is turn out to be using a large
amount of their mental capacity and creative energies
remembering where they placed things, rather than doing
the job. If they worked in a well-organized environment
for any length of time, they would be surprised at how
much more productive they were. If you have a tendency
to attempt to explain a messy desk or work area, challenge
yourself to work with a clean desk for an entire day.

if you walk the same time, distance, and intensity on an

26. Interestingly, people are more overconfident when they
feel like they have control of the outcome ― even when
this is clearly not the case. For example, it is documented
that if people are asked to bet on whether a coin toss is
heads or tails, most bet larger amounts if the coin is yet to
be tossed. If the coin is tossed and the outcome is concealed,
people will offer lower amounts when asked for bets. People
act as if __________________________________________.
In this case, control of the outcome is clearly an illusion.
This perception occurs in investing, as well. Even without
information, people believe the stocks they own will
perform better than stocks they do not own. However,
ownership of a stock only gives the illusion of having
control of the performance of the stock. [3점]
① the amount of the bet will influence the outcome
② their involvement will somehow affect the outcome of the toss
③ there is a parallel between a coin toss and stock investments
④ their illusion will not disappear even after the coin is tossed
⑤ they can predict the outcome with credible information

we meet has a story that can, in some way, inform us
and help us as we live the story of our own lives. When
we acknowledge this truth and begin to look at others as
________________________________, we open ourselves
up to new possibilities in our lives. In reality, the people
who are most different from us probably have the most
to teach us. The more we surround ourselves with people
who are the same as we are, who hold the same views,
and who share the same values, the greater the likelihood
that we will shrink as human beings rather than grow.

28. Although there are numerous explanations for the fall
of the Roman empire, the deeper cause lies in the declining
fertility of its soil and the decrease in agricultural yields.
Italy was densely forested at the beginning of Roman
rule. By the end of the Roman Imperium, however, Italy
had been stripped of forest cover. The timber was sold
on the open market and the soil converted to crops and
pastureland. The cleared soil was rich in minerals and
nutrients and provided substantial production yields.
Unfortunately, deforestation left the soil exposed to harsh
weather. Wind blew across the barren landscapes and
water ran down from the mountaintops and slopes, taking
the soil with them. Overgrazing of livestock resulted in
further deterioration of the soil. Consequently, Rome’s
___________________ could not provide sufficient energy
to maintain its infrastructure and the welfare of its
citizens.
① dense forests
② climate changes
③ irrigation system
④ declining population

29. The identical claim, expressed in two social contexts,
may have different qualifiers. When talking among
friends, you might say, “Lucé is the world’s finest
restaurant.” When speaking to a group of French chefs,
you might find yourself saying, “Lucé is an excellent
restaurant, comparable to some of the best in France.”
Why did you say it differently? Perhaps because you
expected a different critical scrutiny in the two groups.
Maybe because your was strong
enough for friends but not as strong among the most
knowledgeable. In each instance, you communicated the
extent to which you wanted to qualify your claim, to
guard yourself by restricting the extent to which you are
willing to be held accountable for the claim.
① desire to win friendship
② confidence in the claim
③ appetite for French cuisine
④ support for others’ opinions
⑤ suspicion of popular beliefs
30. Often in social scientific practice, even where evidence
is used, it is not used in the correct way for adequate
scientific testing. In much of social science, evidence is
used only to affirm a particular theory ― to search for
the positive instances that uphold it. But these are easy
to find and lead to the familiar dilemma in the social
sciences where we have two conflicting theories, each of
which can claim positive empirical evidence in its support
but which come to opposite conclusions. How should we
decide between them? Here the scientific use of evidence
may help. For what is distinctive about science is the
search for negative instances ― the search for ways to
falsify a theory, rather than to confirm it. The real power
of scientific testability is negative, not positive. Testing
allows us not merely to confirm our theories but to

① ignore the evidence against them
② falsify them by using positive empirical evidence

④ weed out those that do not fit the evidence

The term euphemism derives from a Greek word meaning
‘to speak with good words’ and involves substituting a

‘rough edges’ of life, to make the unbearable bearable

Until the 1920’s, there were only three competitive
swimming strokes ─ freestyle, backstroke, and breaststroke ─
and each had specific rules that described how it was to
be performed. The rules of breaststroke ① stated that
both arms must be pulled together underwater and then
recovered simultaneously back to the start of the pulling
position to begin the next stroke. Most people interpreted
this arm recovery to mean an ② underwater recovery. In
the 1920’s, however, someone ③ challenged the rules and
reinterpreted this arm recovery to be an out-of-the-water
recovery. Since this new breaststroke was about 15%
④ slower, people using the conventional version couldn’t
effectively compete. Something had to be done to solve
the problem. Finally, this new stroke ─ now known as
the ‘butterfly’ ─ won ⑤ recognition as the fourth swimming
stroke, and became an Olympic event in 1956.

34. Living things naturally return to a state of balance.
When we are disturbed by forces acting on us, our inner
machinery kicks in and returns us to a balanced state of
equilibrium. Homeostasis is the word we use to describe
the ability of an organism to maintain internal equilibrium
by adjusting its physiological processes. Most of the
systems in animal and human physiology are controlled
by homeostasis. We don’t like to be off balance. We tend
to keep things in a stable condition. This system operates
at all levels. Our blood stays the same temperature.
Except for extraordinary exceptions, when people find
ways to intervene using methods more powerful than our
tendency to equilibrium, our habits, behaviors, thoughts,
and our quality of life stay pretty much the same too.
① physical balance needed for mental equilibrium
② inner mechanisms to enhance the quality of life
③ general tendency of organisms to keep equilibrium
④ major differences in animal and human physiology
⑤ biological processes resulting from habitual behaviors
35. All of us use the cultural knowledge we acquire as
members of our own society to organize our perception
and behavior. Most of us are also naive realists: we tend
to believe our culture mirrors a reality shared by
everyone. But cultures are different, and other people
rarely behave or interpret experience according to our
cultural plan. For example, an American anthropologist
attempted to tell the classic story of Hamlet to Tiv elders
in West Africa. She believed that human nature is pretty
much the same the whole world over; at least the general
plot and motivation of the great tragedy would always be
clear. But, at each turn in the story when she told it, the
Tiv interpreted the events and motives in Hamlet using
their own cultural knowledge. The result was a very
different version of the classic play.
① cultural differences in perception and interpretation
② tragic characteristics of classic West African plays
③ the positive function of culture as a mirror of reality
④ human nature and its role in developing culture
⑤ the process of acquiring cultural knowledge

Marking the Nepal-Tibet border, Everest looms as a
three-sided pyramid of gleaming ice and dark rock. The
first eight expeditions to Everest were British, all of which
attempted the mountain from the northern, Tibetan, side ―
not because it presented the most obvious weakness in the
peak’s formidable defenses but because in 1921 the
Tibetan government opened its borders to foreigners, while
Nepal remained off limits. The first Everesters were obliged
to trek 400 miles from Darjeeling across the Tibetan plateau
to reach the foot of the mountain. Their knowledge of the
deadly effects of extreme altitude was limited and their
equipment was poor. Yet in 1924, a member of the third
British expedition, Edward Felix Norton, reached an elevation
of 28,126 feet ― just 900 feet below the summit ― before
being defeated by exhaustion and snow blindness. It was an
astounding achievement that was not surpassed for 28 years.
① 처음 여덟 팀의 등반대는 Nepal 쪽에서 등반을 시작했다.
② 최초의 등반대는 Tibet 고원 지대를 우회하여 산기슭에 도달

것은?
Giorgio Vasari, the Italian painter, architect, and writer,
was born in Arezzo in 1511. He was considered to be more
successful as an architect than a painter. But what made
him truly famous was his book Lives of the Most Eminent
Painters, Sculptors and Architects (shortened as Lives). It is
not known exactly how many copies of the first edition of
Lives, published in 1550, were printed, but it earned Vasari
the praise of his peers. Then in a revised edition of Lives
in 1568, complete with portraits of the artists, he combined
biographical anecdotes with critical comment. Although the
revised edition overshadowed Vasari’s own achievements as
a painter and architect, it made him the most respected man
of the Italian art world. He was even knighted by Pope
Pius Ⅴ in 1571.
① Arezzo에서 태어난 이탈리아 화가, 건축가 겸 작가였다.

39. The good news is that it’s never too late to start building
up muscle strength, regardless of your age. Ideally, though,
it’s best to start in your mid-forties when muscle mass
starts to decline significantly. “Once you’ve started, it can
take just six weeks to see an improvement of up to 20
percent in your muscle capabilities,” says Dr. Ward. Studies
have found that intense programs of strength training can
help even weak older people double their strength, as well
as enable them to walk faster and climb stairs more easily.
And muscle isn’t all you gain ― strength training can help
combat osteoarthritis, depression, and risk factors for heart
disease and diabetes.

40. Standard English allows access to certain educational
and economic opportunities, which is the primary reason
for teaching it. Students realize this when they interview
for a first job or when they plan for post-high school
education. So, what should teachers do when a student says,
“I ain’t got no pencil,” or brings some other nonstandard
dialect into the classroom? Opinions vary from ‘rejection
and correction’ to complete acceptance. The approach
most consistent with culturally responsive teaching is to
first accept the dialect and then build on it. For example,
when the student says, “I ain’t got no pencil,” the teacher
might say, “Oh, you don’t have a pencil. What should you
do, then?” Although results won’t be apparent immediately,
the long-range benefits ― both for language development
and attitudes toward school ― are worthwhile.

41. Emotional eaters manifest their problem in lots of
different ways. For many people, one of the classic signs
of emotional eating is night eating. Night eaters are often
eating in response to anxiety or to the emotional turmoil
they’ve experienced throughout the day. Boredom and
loneliness are also more likely to come to the surface
when the rush of the day is done and the night stretches
ahead. Sometimes emotional eating is a reaction to a
specific situation. You had a bad day at work. The kids
have been so demanding that you are completely worn
out. You and your significant other are fighting. It
doesn’t matter what the circumstances are; the end result
is that 99 times out of 100 you end up on the couch

42. Giving people the latitude and flexibility to use their
judgment and apply their talents rapidly accelerates
progress. Send a message of respect and inspire people to
be creative and use their individual talents toward the
goals of the enterprise. Empower people by letting them
know that you believe in them and allowing them to take
action. Trusting people and empowering them also allows
you to focus on the things you need to accomplish. Ellyn
McColgan says, “I used to say to people all the time, ‘I
can help you figure out just about any problem you
throw at me, but is that really what you want from me?’
They would look at me funny and say, ‘Not really.’ I
would say, ‘I think what you would like is to do a great

Then they would respond, ‘Yes, that’s true.’”

The DNA extracted from these bits of whale skin not
only identifies the individuals in the group, but also
reveals their relationships to each other.
Sperm whales travel in social groups that cooperate to
defend and protect each other, and may even share
suckling of calves. ( ① ) It is difficult to determine the
membership of these groups from sightings alone, because
of the practical difficulties of observing whale behavior,
most of which happens underwater. ( ② ) To make
things even more difficult, sperm whales can travel across
entire oceans and can dive to a depth of a kilometer.
( ③ ) Biologists who study whale behavior generally
have to be content with hanging around in boats, waiting
for their subjects to surface. ( ④ ) But when they do
surface, in addition to taking photos which allow
individual whales to be identified, biologists can zip over
in worryingly small boats and pick up the bits of skin
that the whales leave behind on the surface when they
re-submerge. ( ⑤ ) This has allowed researchers to
describe sperm whale social groups in detail.

Mediation is a process that has much in common with
advocacy but is also crucially different. It parallels
advocacy in so far as it tends to involve a process of
negotiation, but differs in so far as mediation involves
adopting a neutral role between two opposing parties
rather than taking up the case of one party against
another. At times, particularly in very complex
situations, the processes of advocacy and mediation can
overlap, perhaps with very problematic results, as one
loses clarity over his or her role. It is therefore
important, if not essential, to maintain a clear focus in
undertaking advocacy or mediation in order to ensure
that the roles do not become blurred and therefore
potentially counterproductive. For example, a mediator
who ‘takes sides’ is likely to lose all credibility, as is
an advocate who seeks to adopt a neutral position.

① neutrality …… avoid
② neutrality …… encourage

(A)
When I was a freshman in high school, I won second
prize in our local newspaper’s essay contest on the theme
of ‘future career.’ I wrote about wanting to become a
journalist. We had to collect our prizes at the local variety
store and, while waiting in line, a little notebook in the
stationery department caught my eye. (a) It was a black
and red hardcover book with the word ‘Record’ neatly
engraved in gold on the cover. I reasoned that since I
was going to be a journalist, I’d need a very special
notebook in which to write. So I bought (b) it.
(B)
Then during a serious illness when I was thirty-five, I
found the little notebook I had purchased twenty years
earlier. From my sick bed I noticed (c) it on a nearby
shelf. It was still blank but something told me to write
my deepest feelings and thoughts, my pain and fear, my
wishes and dreams, the words of my inner world. This
was my first ‘official’ journal. And the process of
journal-keeping through writing and drawing helped heal
me from a mysterious illness which had defied the
doctors and their medicines.
(C)
My life changed so much after that. I began listening
to my own feelings and inner wisdom. The insights I
gained through journal-keeping led me into a new career
as an art therapist and teacher of diary writing and drawing.
More importantly, I learned to play and enjoy life again.
For instance, several years after recovering from my
illness, I started skateboarding for the first time in my
life and loved (d) it. I’m grateful to that high school girl
that I was for having the sense to buy a little blank
book. I used it to save my life and to help others.
(D)
But I put the notebook away and promptly forgot about
(e) it and about becoming a journalist. Painting became
my great love. Upon graduating from high school, I went
to college as a fine art major and English minor. After
becoming a professional artist, marriage followed, then
the birth of two daughters. A career change came next
which led to teaching underprivileged young children in
Los Angeles. The years passed.

Since the beginning of time, the mysterious nature of
dreaming has led people to believe that dreams were
messages from the other world. Dreams have been regarded
as prophetic communications which, when properly decoded,
would enable us to foretell the future. There is, however,
absolutely no scientific evidence for this theory. It is
certainly true that individuals who are concerned about a
traumatic event, such as the threat of the loss of a loved
one who is sick, will dream about that loved one more
than would otherwise be the case. If the dreamer then calls
and finds that the loved one has died, it is understandable
for him or her to assume that the dream was a premonition
of that death. But this is a mistake. It is simply a(n)
correspondence between a situation about
which one has intense concern and the occurrence of the
event that one fears.
To prove the existence of premonitory dreams, scientific
evidence must be obtained. We would need to do studies
in which individuals are sampled in terms of their dream
life and judges are asked to make correspondences between
these dream events and events that occurred in real life. A
problem that arises here is that individuals who believe in
premonitory dreams may give one or two striking examples
of ‘hits,’ but they never tell you how many of their
premonitory dreams ‘missed.’ To do a scientific study of
dream prophecy, we would need to establish some base of
how commonly correspondences occur between
dream and waking reality. Until we have that evidence,
it is better to believe that the assumption is false.
