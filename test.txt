18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
Earth is a large, round planet. To see all of Earth, we would have to go around it in a spacecraft. Thanks to this, however, we don’t have to do that. Shaped like a soccer ball, this represents Earth as round rather than flat, and shows what it would look like from outer space. This shows distances, directions, and the shapes and sizes of areas on Earth. This also has a number of lines including one that runs around the center and divides it into two halves horizontally.

Many people believe that a snowflake cannot last more than a few minutes indoors because (1) it is a frozen water crystal. However, you can catch a snowflake and keep (2) it forever. According to the chemist Tryggvi Emlisson, ‘superglue’ can be used to do this job. It is a thin, runny glue with special molecules which hardens anything (3) it touches. With that in mind, Emlisson did an experiment with a snowflake in January 1979. He took a snowflake, locked (4) it in a drop of the ‘superglue,’ and kept it for decades. Recently he showed that (5) it was still well-preserved.

Sometimes promises made in good faith can’t be kept. Even though we strive to be error-free, it’s inevitable that problems will occur. Not everything that affects your customer’s experience with you is within your control. What should you do when the service promise is broken? When you discover a broken promise or have one pointed out to you, the first thing to do is to apologize. Don’t waste time blaming yourself, your company, or your customer. Admit that something has gone wrong, and immediately find out what your customer’s needs are.

It’s not just to amaze our friends with our own profound thinking, or confuse them with (B)unexpected/unexpectedly questions, although some college students may value that possibility the most in taking philosophy courses.

College life is busy. There are too many demands on your schedule. Activities, friends, and pastimes may cause some difficulties in your (1) performing the real job at hand.

However, this lack of time for relaxation makes it more difficult (4) get the most out of your studies.

23. 다음 글에서 전체 흐름과 관계 없는 문장은?
Few animals have been so mercilessly exploited for their fur as the beaver. (1) In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, beaver furs were worth their weight in gold. (2) As a result, by 1896, at least 14 American states had announced that all of their beavers had been killed. (3) By the beginning of the twentieth century, it looked as if the beaver was about to disappear from the face of the earth. (4) The beaver is a furry animal like a large rat with a big flat tail. (5) However, thanks to a beaver recovery program, which included trapping and relocating to protected areas, particularly in suburban areas of the United States, beavers have made an impressive comeback throughout the country.

24. Whether you are vacationing in Europe, spending the winter in Florida, or just visiting a friend’s house for the weekend, a successful trip depends on good packing. Nothing is more frustrating than arriving at your destination only to realize that you have left behind your toothbrush, pajamas, important medication, or travel documents. Successful packing requires you to remember everything that you normally need in daily life, as well as any special items you will need at your destination. Unfortunately, most of us pack at the last minute, and this kind of stress can interfere with our memories, increasing the chances of our___________something we might need.

25. The distinctive property of cultural behavior, as ethologists use the term, is the way it is passed on from one generation to the next. Instead of being inherited by the process of Mendelian genetics, it is ‘inherited’ by imitation. An animal acquires a behavior pattern by imitating it from another. Thus, for a species to acquire a culture, its members should be able not only to learn and memorize but also to meet other members of its own species sufficiently often. Cultural behavior is, therefore, most likely to be found in species that ________________.

26. How can I learn to be a manager? A familiar answer to this question is to say that managers learn from experience. But can experience alone be the best way to be a manager? Several writers have expressed their doubts on this matter. Oscar Wilde noted that ‘experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.’ And the historian Froude wrote that ‘experience teaches slowly and at the cost of mistakes.’ Experience is an essential way of learning to improve but is an __________ instrument. We also need guidance from a good manager who will help us to learn from mistakes and make better use of them in the future.
(1) ideal	(2) unnecessary	(3) efficient
(4) innovative	(5) imperfect 



27. Even a relatively small increase in _______________ can make people much happier and lengthen their lives. This was evident when doctors in retirement villages in the United States encouraged residents to decide the details of their daily lives themselves. They were no longer simply presented with their meals, but could choose from a menu. While previously the caretakers watered the plants, the elderly took over this responsibility for themselves. These small changes worked miracles. The senior citizens became ill less frequently, and in interviews expressed greater happiness. Most striking of all, the annual death rate was reduced by half.

Anyone who lost his or her temper too easily was deprived of the right to be accepted as a member of the community.

31. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘I’의 심경을 가장 잘 나타낸 것은?
I heard a sound, and my heart beat quickly. I was excited, and when at last I saw him coming slowly down the stairs, I caught my breath. He was a tall old man with abundant white hair, but his bushy eyebrows were dark still; they made his great eyes flash with a more grave fire. It was wonderful that at his age those black eyes should still preserve their brilliance. There were in his air assurance and gentleness. He was as I should have wished him to be, and as I watched him, I understood how he had moved men’s minds and touched their hearts. He was every inch a poet.

32. 다음 글의 주장으로 가장 적절한 것은?
In the United States, some people maintain that TV media will create a distorted picture of a trial, while leading some judges to pass harsher sentences than they otherwise might. However, there are some benefits connected to the televising of trials. It will serve to educate the public about the court process. It will also provide full and accurate coverage of exactly what happens in any given case. Therefore, it is necessary to televise trials to increase the chance of a fair trial. And, if trials are televised, a huge audience will be made aware of the case, and crucial witnesses who would otherwise have been ignorant of the case may play their potential role in it.

33. In World War II, some musicians offered to play for the entertainment of wounded soldiers. They were surprised to see that their performances achieved more than they had expected at first: a diversion from the boredom and routine of hospital life.

Since then, music has come to be recognized as a practical and productive way to improve physical, emotional, and mental conditions.

34. Man has built his world: he has built factories and houses, he produces cars and clothes, he grows grain and fruit, and so on. But he is not really the master any more of the world he has built; on the contrary, this man-made world has become his master, before whom he bows down, and whom he tries to please as best he can. The work of his own hands has become his master. He seems to be driven by self-interest, but in reality he has become an instrument for the purposes of the very machine his hands have built.

36. One of the most important aspects of human communication is that past experiences will affect your behavior. Even when you start to discuss some event with your friends, you may soon discover there are differences in your perceptions. What you think boring your friends may find exciting; what you consider pointless they may find meaningful. The messages you receive may be the same for each of you. Yet, each person experiences a variety of feelings and sensations, because each has a unique personality and background. Each of you brings different backgrounds to the event and, as a result, each attributes different meanings to the shared experience.

37. The family is an easy target for those who regard ‘bad people doing bad things’ as the basic cause of social problems. They assume that when the family fails, the rest of society fails. This view of the world is defective in two fundamental respects. First, it does not consider the fact that families reflect social conditions. Second, it ignores the structural reasons for family breakdown and the profound changes occurring throughout the world. Even in very different societies, families are going through similar changes as a result of global economic changes. This phenomenon shows the fact that families cannot avoid social influences on their everyday lives.

38. Oak tree에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은? 
Oaks are kings of the forest. Most of these trees take 100 years to reach maturity. They can grow up to 150 feet high. The trees have thick trunks and large, wide-spreading branches. The leaf is usually deeply toothed, but in some species it is almost smooth at the edge. Oaks vary in appearance but are easily recognized by their fruit―a round nut set in a woody cup. Native Americans and New England pioneers boiled and ate the nuts of the white oak. Squirrels and some birds store them for winter food. Oaks grow widely throughout the mild temperature zone of the Northern Hemisphere. A few species grow at high altitudes in the tropics.

39. Maria Edgeworth에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
Maria Edgeworth was born in Oxfordshire in 1767. On her father’s second marriage in 1773, she went with him to Ireland. Her father employed her in keeping accounts and in dealing with tenants. She also acquired a familiarity with fashionable people and with poor Irish farmers, all of which was to be of use in her novels. Her father made her a confidential friend, and he also became her literary adviser. Much of her early writing was for children, and it was not until 1800 that she appeared as a novelist for adult readers with the publication of Castle Rackrent. Its detailed description of Irish characters made the book an instant success. After the publication of the book, she became one of Ireland’s major female writers.

While browsing through reading materials, he came across an article in a scientific journal.

A group of scientists was doing research on superconductivity but reached a dead end. ((1))They finally gave up, putting the work aside so that they could concentrate on other activities. ((2))One of the scientists on this project decided to take a break and went down to the company library. ((3))The article approached the subject of superconductivity from a completely different direction from the one they had been working on. ((4))He immediately began applying it to their experiments and within 12 months they discovered the secret to superconductivity. ((5))Not long after, they were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics.

41. The zoologist and specialist in human behavior, Desmond Morris, says that the reason people start to walk like each other is that they have a subconscious need to show their companions that they agree with them and so fit in with them. This is also a signal to other people that ‘we are together, we are acting as one.’ Other studies suggest that we adopt the mannerisms of our company as well, especially our superiors, such as crossing our legs in the same direction as others. An example often given is when, in a meeting, the boss scratches his nose and others at the table then follow him without realizing it.

42. It is evident that humans tend to exploit natural resources to benefit themselves. It is equally evident that the use of natural resources without restoring them will eventually lead to their destruction. There are two extreme positions on the issue. Some people maintain that human dominance in nature is a natural process, and as the dominant species humans have the right to exploit all other species. Other people recognize humans as the only one among the living organisms that can change its behavior to preserve other species. They believe that humans have the moral obligation to protect all other forms of life.

There were some places of worship in the city, and the deep notes of their bells echoed over the town from morning until night. The sun was shining brightly and cheerily, and the air was warm. The streams were flowing with bubbling water, and the tender songs of birds came floating in from the fields beyond the city. The trees were already awake and embraced by the blue sky. Everything around the neighborhood, the trees, the sky, and the sun, looked so young and intimate that they were reluctant to break the spell which might last forever.

You might think iced desserts would be a fairly recent creation due to the problems of refrigeration in the past.

(A)What we call ice cream today was created in the early seventeenth century by a French chef for King CharlesⅠof England. After that, it was introduced and popularized in the United States by First Lady Dolly Madison.
(B)He brought the recipe back to Italy, where it has been a favorite ever since. The Arabs and Indians picked up the idea from the Chinese as well, and named this delicious dessert sherbet. But it did not have the exact form and name of ice cream yet.
(C)The Chinese, however, who had perfected ice storage using the principle of evaporation in the eighth century B.C., were enjoying fruit-flavored ices by the time Marco Polo visited in the thirteenth century.

While we’re walking or traveling, we normally spend less than a second looking at everyday objects that we encounter. The days pass by us without our really being aware of them. Scientists have discovered that the average time we spend looking at things has been steadily decreasing during the last 50 years. In their study, they also discovered that this decrease leads to a lack of interest and enjoyment in life. Just try looking at objects for at least five seconds. Good opportunities for this exercise come when you’re walking or looking out of a car or train window. You’ll find that five seconds is long enough to help you appreciate things from a new point of view.

(A)
The seagull, a hawk, and an eagle all laughed heartily. A crow listened gravely. “For fifteen years, I’ve flown this country,” said the eagle, “and I assure you there is no such thing as air crystallizing. Water, yes; air, no.” “You were probably struck by a hailstone,” the hawk told the sparrow. “Or he may have had a stroke,” said the seagull. “What do you think, crow?” “Why, I think maybe the air crystallized on him,” said the crow.
*hailstone: 우박
(B)
A short time ago some builders, working on a studio in Connecticut, left a huge square of plate glass standing upright in a field. A sparrow flying swiftly across the field struck the glass and was knocked out. He woke and went to his club, where an attendant bandaged his head. “What happened?” asked a seagull. “I was flying across a meadow when all of a sudden the air crystallized on me,” said the sparrow.
(C)
The large birds laughed so loudly that the sparrow became annoyed. And then the sparrow bet each of them ten worms that they couldn’t follow the course he had flown without encountering the hardened atmosphere. They all took his bet; the crow went along to watch. Later, the seagull, the eagle, and the hawk decided to fly together over the route the sparrow indicated. “You come, too,” they said to the crow. “I..., I..., well, no,” said the crow. “I don’t think I will.” So, the three large birds took off together. And they hit the glass together and were all knocked out.

[49~50] 두 사람의 대립된 의견을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오. 
[Person A]Can you imagine what the world today would be like if Leonardo da Vinci had become a farmer or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart a banker? What would the world be like without art? To protect and promote culture, governments have a responsibility as representatives of society to (A) the arts. Cultural property is not always in fashion, but remains important. Who, if not the government, would house these treasures for future generations? Without governmental aid to the arts, there would be a great deal of culture lost because of a lack of funding to either promote their creation or protect them for future generations.

[Person B]The importance of art is determined by the people who value it, not by governments acting as its protectors. Culture should not be shaped by governments, but grow naturally from a society of people. When artists show that they are truly gifted, their genius will be recognized and rewarded. If not, it simply has no value in society. It would be absurd to suggest that the government (B) great plumbers, dentists, or bankers. So, it is also absurd to suggest that governments decide what art is and attempt to preserve items they regard as representative of our lives.

18. 밑줄 친 This[this]가 가리키는 것으로 가장 적절한 것은? [1점]
This refers to a kind of building for sheltering animals, their feed, farm supplies, farm machinery, and farm products. Sometimes this is used for storing hay and grain, too. The need for this has declined with the introduction of tractors and electrical services. Traditionally, wood was used in constructing this, but sheet steel and aluminum have been increasingly used since World War II, particularly on large farms in North American and European countries. This usually consists of two stories, the first to shelter animals or machines and the second to store hay or grain.

Whether woven or printed, a fine tie is a work of art from beginning to end. Woven silk ties are the most luxurious of all. Though less common today, (1)they were at one time the essential accessory of a true gentleman. Because of (2)their high manufacturing cost, woven silk ties are very expensive. This in part accounts for the fact that (3)they now represent only five percent of tie production. But (4)they will never fall entirely by the wayside and will make periodic comebacks. Printed silk ties are much cheaper and simpler than (5)their woven counterparts. However, silk printing demands a high level of technical mastery. 	*woven: (실로) 짠

Although most people use the bus or subway to get around Seoul, every once in a while it’s nice to spend a sunny day crossing the city on a bicycle. While riding, you are certain to discover new streets and different views of the capital. “The key to enjoying cycling is to choose the right streets,” says one city official, adding that alleys off main roads can be interesting areas to explore. If you only ride occasionally, you don’t have to spend a lot of money because bikes can be rented. Let’s discover Seoul and learn about its undiscovered back streets on a bike.

The bodies of flowing ice we call glaciers (1)are the most spectacular of natural features. They result from densely packed snow. Unlike a stream, a glacier cannot be seen (2)move. Accurate measurements, however,  show that it is flowing. Erosion of bedrock by glaciers and deposits of the eroded materials are characteristic and (3)easily recognizable. Their distribution enables us to infer that in the recent past glaciers have been far more extensive (4)than they are today. At the same time, this evidence has (5)raised the problem of the cause of the ‘ice ages.’ 	*erode: 침식하다

When drawing human figures, children often make the head too large for the rest of the body. A recent study offers some insight into this common imbalance in children’s drawings. (1)As part of the study, researchers asked children between four and seven years old to make several drawings of adults. (2)When they drew frontal views of the adults, the size of the heads was markedly enlarged. (3)Adults tended to draw children’s faces larger than their own. (4)However, when the children drew rear views of the adults, the size of the heads was not nearly so exaggerated. (5)The researchers suggest that children draw bigger heads when they know that they must leave space for facial details.

24. Often the best form of communication with friends is, surprisingly, ____________. Friendship is not only about what we say, but even more importantly about what we do not. True friendship occurs when ‘information’ is conveyed by absences of words. The point is to convey as much as possible indirectly, ‘between the lines.’ The reason such ‘negative’ communication is important is that it requires a greater closeness than positive communication. The greater the distance between sender and receiver, the more the need for directness. Only when two or more people share an enormous amount can the much more economical negative communication take place.
(1) silence	(2) sincerity	(3) negotiation
(4) honesty	(5) courage


25. Team performance is not possible if the leader grabs all the best chances, assignments and credit for himself or herself. Indeed, the crucial point of the leader’s challenge is to _________________________________. When the Dollus Bank team leader Trevor Canfield made room for a junior investment banker to lead a prestigious account, he did just that. So did Mike Fangos at Gopak, when he encouraged a chemical engineer who “could not balance his checkbook at home” to take responsibility for preparing the Zebra Team’s $200 million budget. Stepping out of the way to give opportunities to others, however, does not mean giving up responsibility for guidance, monitoring, and control. [3점]
(1) drive all of the team members into competition
(2)give direct instructions and orders to the executives
(3) recruit competent and qualified people for the team  
(4) take charge of all assignments by himself or herself
(5)provide performance opportunities to the team members
26. Michel de Montaigne, the sixteenth-century French essayist, loved conversation. “To my taste,” he says, “the most fruitful and natural exercise of our mind is conversation. I find the practice of it the most delightful activity in our lives.” According to Montaigne, “studying books is a weak mental activity, while conversation provides teaching and excercise all at once.” Montaigne thinks of conversation as ______________________ that will improve his mind. “If I am fighting with a strong and solid opponent, he will attack me; his ideas send mine soaring. Rivalry, competitiveness and glory will drive me and raise me above my own level. Our mind is strengthened by contact with dynamic and well-ordered minds.”
(1) a regular meditation	(2) an accidental discovery
(3) an efficient field study	(4) a psychological disorder
(5) an intellectual sporting event

27. Studies regarding our habits of eating out found that, when we eat out, we tend to underestimate the number of calories we consume by up to half. When we eat in a relaxing, candle-lit restaurant, we tend to enjoy our food longer even if we are full. Dining with friends also contributes to consuming more calories. Researchers found that women who dined with two or three friends ate 700 calories on average, double that of solo diners. Our psychology is another factor in the consumption of calories. A waiter who greeted customers with the question, “What are we celebrating tonight?” _______________________ than waiters who didn’t. Therefore, if you treat dining as a special occasion, you’re more likely to eat more. 
(1) got more orders	(2)dined out more frequently
(3) was in a worse mood	(4)delivered food more slowly
(5) consumed more calories

When whales are gone, the whole chain of life in the sea, as we know it, will be (B)upset/stable. And eventually this will have a direct effect on the life of man, too. Although there are international agreements signed by some governments, people are killing whales without considering what future (C)conveniences/consequences this will have.

When a ballet dancer leaps across the stage in a grand jump, her center of mass faithfully follows a parabolic path during the jump. The distance between the top of her head and her center of mass (1)changes depending upon the movements of her legs. When she (2)stretches her legs out horizontally after her feet leave the stage, her center of mass moves upward. It results in an (3)increase in the distance between the top of her head and her center of mass. In contrast, when the dancer (4)lowers her legs toward the ground, the opposite occurs. The height of the top of her head remains (5)constant throughout the jump. The result gives the impression that the dancer is drifting through the air.

Soaring eagles have the incredible ability to see a mouse in the grass from a mile away.    (A)   , cats have the extraordinary ability to see in the dark. Through natural selection over time, these animals have developed  visual systems uniquely adapted to their way of life. The human visual system has also adapted to many things well.

31. 다음 글에 드러난 Henry의 심경 변화로 가장 적절한 것은?
Henry was moving the soccer ball down the field thrilled with the prospect of scoring a goal−the first in his entire life. In his haste, he didn’t realize that his teammates weren’t anywhere near him. Concentrating, filled with expectation, he sped eagerly toward the goal. It wasn’t until the last second that he noticed who the goalkeeper was−his teammate! It was too late, however, as Henry’s foot had already begun moving to kick the ball into the net. A perfect kick! Then total silence! Henry realized that he had made a terrible mistake. He had scored for the opposing team. Henry glanced at his coach who looked furious as he screamed at him. He wanted the earth to swallow him up.

32. 다음 글에서 필자가 주장하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은?
Children grow up and leave home. They go from helpless babies to mature adults while our back is turned. The secret is to try and keep pace with them. We have to resist the urge to do everything for them, and let them fry eggs or paint trash cans for themselves. By the time they reach adolescence, we may expect them to be able to keep their room tidy for the first time. But they have never done it before. They have to learn how to do it, and part of that learning process is not doing it, doing it badly, and doing it differently from how we would do it. Growing is a messy business. Our job is to help them, that is, to hand them responsibility slowly, bit by bit.
(1) Assist kids in doing their homework.
(2) Give kids the chance to learn responsibility. 
(3) Set strict rules for the benefit of your kids.
(4) Teach kids to help their neighbors in need.
(5) Allow kids to experience messy things first.

33. Many years ago, my drama director, frustrated with my bad acting in a play, shouted, “No! No! Your body is contradicting your words. Every tiny movement reveals your private thoughts.” Then he said something I’ll never forget: “The way you move is your autobiography in motion.” How right he was! On the stage of real life, every physical move you make subconsciously tells everyone the story of your life. As dogs hear sounds our ears can’t detect, people make and notice moves that are beneath human consciousness but have tremendous power to attract or offend.
(1) body movement as a reflection of our mind
(2) sign language as an indicator of nervousness
(3) cultural differences in writing autobiographies
(4) the hidden power of human consciousness in drama
(5)the contrast between animal and human hearing systems

34. Science is all about trying ideas, abandoning those that don’t work, and building on those that do. It never stops. Those people in the past who had wrong ideas weren’t fools. They were doing the best they could, given the knowledge of their times. We do the same thing today. And you can be sure that people in the future will look back and wonder why we believe some of the things we do. Does that make science unimportant? If some of our scientific theories are going to be proved false, why bother studying them? If you believe something is an absolute truth, you can just memorize it and get on with your life. After all, there is always something to explore in the world.

(1)Friends, parents, and relatives were the three most common sources of advice for all age groups, although their relative importance varied with age. (2)As age increased, friends progressively became a more important source of advice, while parents and relatives became less important. (3)Those aged from 11 to 14 turned more often to parents than friends for advice. (4)For young Australians aged from 15 to 19, friends was the biggest source of advice, followed by parents. (5)For those aged from 20 to 24, their dependence upon mass media was the lowest among the three age groups, while their dependence upon teachers was the highest.

The result is that the population enters a period of rapid growth.

There is an interesting relationship between a country’s developmental progress and its population structure. (　(1)　) According to the theory of demographic transition, nations go through several developmental stages. (　(2)　) The earliest stage is characterized by high birth and death rates and slow growth. (　(3)　)　As they begin to develop, the birth rate remains high, but the death rate falls. (　(4)　)  Then, as industrialization peaks, the birth rate falls and begins to approximate the death rate. (　(5)　) Eventually, population growth slows drastically, reaching a stage of very modest growth which is seen in many European nations today. 	*demographic: 인구(통계)의

[37~38] 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오. 
37. “What is value to the customer?” is the most important question in business, yet is rarely asked. One reason is that managers are quite sure that they know the answer. Value is what they, in their business, define as quality. But this is almost always the wrong definition. The customer never buys a product but the satisfaction of a want. For the teenage girl, for instance, value in a shoe is high fashion. Price is a secondary consideration and durability is not value at all. For the same girl as a young mother, a few years later, what she looks for is durability, price and comfort.	*durability: 내구성

38. By thinking the right thoughts, you can make any job less distasteful. Your boss wants you to be more interested in your job so that he or she will make more money. But let’s forget about what the boss wants. Think only of what getting interested in your job will do for you. Remind yourself that it may double the amount of happiness you get out of life, for you spend about one half of your waking hours at work. Keep reminding yourself that getting interested in your job will take your mind off your worries, and in the long run, will probably bring about promotion and increased pay. Even if it doesn’t do that, it will reduce fatigue to a minimum and help you enjoy your hours of leisure.

39. artificial skin에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은?
A group of researchers have recently developed an artificial skin that can detect both pressure and temperature at the same time. They inserted pressure sensors and temperature sensors in a thin plastic film to create a net-like structure. The new artificial skin is flexible enough to wrap around robot fingers and relatively inexpensive to make. This breakthrough has the potential to improve how robots will function in the real world. Future artificial skins could incorporate sensors not only for pressure and temperature, but also for light, humidity, strain or sound.

40. red fox에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하는 것은?
The red fox often acts in ways that seem extremely crafty. Trappers seeking red foxes must clean their equipment well to rid it of human smells, or the foxes will not come near. The foxes also manage to dig up hidden traps and set them off without being caught. Red foxes have even been known to use a pedestrian underpass rather than cross a highway. On the other hand, red foxes are sometimes extremely careless. They often come running in response to an imitation of their bark, regardless of danger. They readily return to areas where they have been heavily hunted in the past. So whether or not the red fox is especially intelligent is an open question.

41. Sleep recharges our brains and helps us think more clearly. But more importantly it is a time when noise from the world outside is shut off and creative energy from the deepest inner mind can break through. It’s no wonder why you often wake up with great ideas after a sound sleep. Or why Elias Howe thought of the idea of a sewing machine after waking up. Or why Dmitri Mendeleev literally dreamed up the periodic table of elements. If you aren’t making time for sleep, you are limiting your creativity and your life’s potential.

42. All cells need energy to live, whether they are muscle cells in a hiker’s leg, or young yeast cells turning a tank of grape juice into wine. Regardless of type, however, no cell can ‘make’ energy. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but can merely be transformed from one state to another. Each cell must therefore obtain its energy from some outside environmental source, and cells do so in a range of ways. Yeast cells growing on a grape skin obtain energy from nutrient molecules originally processed within the grape leaves and stored within the fruit. Humans obtain energy from molecules present in the plant and animal matter they eat and digest. 	*yeast: 효모

Twenty-four-year-old Bob was swimming along the beach about one hundred yards offshore. When he was  forty feet away from a group of bathers who were swimming in about five feet of water, he suddenly let out a scream. All the bathers could hear was a lot of noise resulting from Bob’s attempts to get out of the water. One of the group, Tim, realizing that something was wrong, rushed to Bob’s aid. Tim grabbed the struggling Bob and attempted to pull him toward shore, but in vain. Some lifeguards immediately launched their surf boat and set out toward the troubled swimmer.

  When a basketball team finds itself on the wrong side of momentum, or when its opponent has gained the advantage, the coach calls for a timeout.

(A)Likewise, we must occasionally call timeout. In the cycles of life and business we have times when we must break the rhythm of failure and loss. During this break in the action we must determine what is working and what is not.
(B)The pause along with the adjusted game plan can also increase the team’s confidence and break its downward cycle. It can change the rhythm of the game. 
(C)The timeout can break the momentum and allows the coach to adjust the game plan. He may have noticed a weakness on the other side that his team can utilize.	*momentum: 여세, 힘

  I believe mystery plays a fundamental role in experiencing the great things in life. If you can determine the chemicals that exist in a food or wine, does that help you understand why you like the taste? Do you think that being able to list all the reasons you love a person enables you to love that person more or differently? If something is beautiful to you, can you really explain why in a meaningful way? There are many sensations and feelings that we can experience but not fully define. Once we give up the belief that definition of these emotions is necessary or possible, we can actually experience them more completely because we have removed the analytical filter we use to find definitions.

[46~48] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
(A)
My freshman year flew by. Your Spanish class quickly became my favorite class. You taught us through arts and crafts, music, and pictures. All of your classes were incredibly visually stimulating. Your classes were just unusual enough to be completely memorable. Before I knew it, I found myself looking forward to your class, which was the last period of the day. I barely realized that the 180th day had arrived. I had done well throughout the year, and felt that I had learned a reasonable amount of new information, but that certainly didn’t mean that I understood Spanish. You still had to prove me wrong, as you’d promised so many months ago. 
(B)
I walked into your class for the last time, ever skeptical, and listened as you reread the passage from the first class. My jaw dropped in amazement when, as promised, I understood every word! All of those episodes of Muzzy cartoons and silly mnemonic devices had actually come together to form something surprisingly intelligible. I looked around at the rest of the class. The stunned faces that surrounded me proved that everyone else had also understood. The feeling of pride and accomplishment that came over me was incredible, and it is something that I will never forget.
	*mnemonic: 기억을 도와주는
(C)
On the first day of Spanish class, you read us a paragraph in a language that we knew nothing about, and I didn’t understand a word of it. From the panicked faces I saw around the room, none of my classmates did either. You promised us that on the last day of class when you reread it, we would understand. I rolled my eyes, knowing that there was no way I would be able to comprehend something so foreign by June. I gave you 180 days to prove me wrong, but remained content in knowing that you wouldn’t be able to do it.

[49~50] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.
Mel, a chimpanzee in Gombe, Nigeria, was three years old when his mother died. He had no elder brother or sister to adopt him. To our amazement, he was adopted by a twelve-year-old chimpanzee, Spindle, who was certainly not related to Mel. As weeks passed, the two became    (A)   . Spindle took care of Mel while traveling; he permitted (a)the infant to ride on his back, even allowed him to hang beneath, as a mother carries her baby. Most remarkably, if Mel got too close to the big males, Spindle would hurry to remove (b)his small charge from danger even though this meant he got into trouble himself. 
For a whole year, this relationship endured, and there was no doubt that Spindle saved Mel’s life. Why did Spindle act that way, burdening himself with the care of (c)a sickly youngster? Probably we shall never know, but it is interesting to reflect that during the plague that claimed Mel’s mother, Spindle’s mother also died. Is it possible that Spindle’s loss of his mother left an empty space in his life? And that the contact with (d)a dependent baby helped to fill that space? Or did Spindle experience an emotion similar to that which we call(B)   ? Perhaps (e)the lonely chimpanzee felt a mixture of both.

This is different from all other markets in that people do not buy things here such as clothes, shoes, or cars. Thanks to this, people can easily exchange one country’s money with that of another. People desire to make such exchanges for many reasons. Some are concerned with the import or export of goods or services between one country and another. Others wish to move capital from one area to another. Still others may want to travel to a foreign country. This is incredibly important to the global economy. This gets influenced by a real world event, and has an impact on the economy of a nation, causing the value of its money to rise and fall.

As the pilot was about to make an announcement, (3)he thought, ‘This is it. He’s going to tell us we’ve got a major problem.’ Instead, (4)he told the passengers, “In case you’re worried about the flashing lights outside the plane, I’m sending a signal to my kids.” (5)He was relieved to hear the continued announcement: “They’re at home over on that hill to the left, and they just sent me a Morse code message saying, ‘Good night, Dad.’”

If you are worrying about money when you are away, your enjoyment will suffer. Plan your budget in advance to give yourself time to research the costs fully. If you cannot get confirmed prices, get as many estimates as you can. Note the best price and the worst price and budget in between the two. Ideally, the budgeted figures will work out just about right. If they don’t, you will have to use your emergency fund to cover basic expenses such as food, transport, and accommodation, and there will be less money available for an unexpected situation that necessitates a sudden change of plan. So, be sure to make your budget realistic, so that you can be confident that you will be able to pay for all aspects of the trip.

21. (A), (B), (C)의 각 네모 안에서 어법에 맞는 표현으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Many social scientists have believed for some time (A)that/what birth order directly affects both personality and achievement in adult life. In fact, people have been using birth order to account for personality factors such as an aggressive behavior or a passive temperament. One might say, “Oh, I’m the eldest of three sisters, so I can’t help that I’m so overbearing,” or “I’m not very successful in business, because I’m the youngest child and thus less (B)aggressively/aggressive than my older brothers and sisters.” Recent studies, however, have proved this belief to be false. In other words, birth order may define your role within a family, but as you mature into adulthood, (C)accepted/accepting other social roles, birth order becomes insignificant.

You may think that moving a short distance is so easy that you can do it in no time with (1)little effort. You may decide to use your own car because you think that you don’t need the services of a moving company. Well, you might be wrong. You are under the false impression that you do not have as many items to pack as you really (2)do. You find out (3)too late that your car cannot carry as much as you thought it could. So, it takes you far more trips to your new home than you thought it would. There is also the possibility of (4)damage your stuff, some of it valuable. All these things (5)considered, it might be better to ask for the services of a moving company.

Roman doll-makers continued to use technology developed by the Egyptians and Greeks, but in line with the artistic sensibilities of their culture, they were constantly trying to make dolls more elegant and beautiful. (1)One doll, found near Prati in Rome, was made of ivory and lay beside her owner who had died at the age of eighteen. (2)The huge growth in the understanding of civilization raised awareness of other important roles of trade. (3)Next to the doll was a small box, also made of ivory, containing tiny combs and a silver mirror. (4)The doll had rings on her fingers and held a tiny key, which unlocked the box. (5)Like children today, the younger members of Roman civilization would have dressed and undressed their dolls, and decorated their hair and fingers according to the latest fashions.

24. While the fine art object is valued because it is unique, it is also valued because it can be reproduced for                . For example, Van Gogh’s paintings have been reproduced endlessly on posters, postcards, coffee mugs, and T-shirts. Ordinary consumers can own a copy of the highly valued originals. Therefore, the value of the original results not only from its uniqueness but from its being the source from which reproductions are made. The manufacturers who produce art reproductions and the consumers who purchase and display them give value to the work of art by making it available to many people as an item of popular culture.
(1) art education	(2) artists’ imagination
(3) cultural diversity	(4) scholarly research
(5) popular consumption



25. There are some people who believe that no one should be trusted. They usually feel this way because their behavior compels others to lie to them. In other words, they make it difficult for others to tell them the truth because they respond rudely or emotionally to people who tell the truth. If others see how angry, hurt, or hateful you become when they tell you the truth, they will avoid telling it to you at all costs. If you are known as someone who is easily offended, you will never know what others are really thinking or feeling because they will                 to escape from your negative reaction. If you demand that children tell you the truth and then punish them because it is not very satisfying, you teach them to lie to you to protect themselves.
(1) distort the truth	(2) protect their children
(3) waste your expenses	(4) hurt your feelings
(5) reveal their anger
26. One of the main principles I follow when I draw outside is                                   . I try to stay away from houses or barns that have unusual angles of the roof, or objects that look incorrect in size, perspective, or design. If the subject is confusing when you look at it, it will be more confusing when you attempt to draw it. I know a beautiful barn where the corners are not at right angles. No matter how many times I have drawn it, the perspective does not look right. If I were to make an accurate drawing of this barn and put it in a show, I’m sure I would get all kinds of criticism for my poor perspective. I would not be there to tell my critics that the barn is actually constructed this way. So, I stay away from subjects that do not look right to me.
(1) to convert inaccurate drawings into accurate ones
(2) not to draw any objects that others have drawn
(3) to draw an object with imagination
(4) to get information from abstract subjects
(5) not to select a subject that is too difficult or odd

27. When faced with things that are too big to sense, we comprehend them by                                 . The first appearance of a shining star in a darkening evening sky can take you out into the universe if you combine what you see with the twin facts that the star is merely one of the closest of the galaxy’s 200 billion stars and that its light began traveling decades ago. The smell of gasoline going into a car’s tank during a refueling stop, when combined with the fact that each day nearly a billion gallons of crude oil are refined and used in the United States, can allow our imagination to spread outward into the vast global network of energy trade and politics.

(3) comparing the universe with human beings

The first experiments in television broadcasting began in France in the 1930s, but the French were slow to employ the new technology. There were several reasons for this (A)hesitancy/consistency. Radio absorbed the majority of state resources, and the French government was reluctant to shoulder the financial burden of developing national networks for television broadcasting. Television programming costs were too high, and program output correspondingly low. Poor (B)distribution/description combined with minimal offerings provided little incentive to purchase the new product. Further, television sets were priced beyond the means of a general public whose modest living standards, especially in the 1930s and 1940s, did not allow the acquisition of luxury goods. Ideological influences also factored in; elites in particular were (C)optimistic/skeptical of television, perceiving it as a messenger of mass culture and Americanization.

A violin creates tension in its (1)strings and gives each of them an equilibrium shape: a straight line. A tight violin string can be viewed as composed of many individual pieces that are connected in a chain as in the above two figures. When the string is (2)straight, as in Figure 1, its tension is uniform, and the two outward forces on a given piece sum to zero; they have equal magnitudes and point in (3)opposite directions. With no net forces acting on its pieces, the string is in equilibrium. But when the string is (4)curved, as in Figure 2, the outward forces on its pieces no longer sum to zero. Although the string’s uniform tension still gives those outward forces equal magnitudes, they now point in slightly different directions, and each piece experiences a (5)zero net force. The net forces on its pieces are restoring forces, which will cause the string to vibrate and thus make sounds.
*equilibrium: 평형   **magnitude: 크기


30. 다음 글에 드러난 ‘She’의 심정으로 가장 적절한 것은?
Her nerves were hurting her. She looked automatically again at the high, uncurtained windows. As night fell, she could just perceive outside a huge tree swinging its branches. The rain came flying on the window. Ah, why didn’t she have peace? These two men, her husband and her son, why did they not come? She wrapped a large scarf around her and hesitated for a moment. She opened the door and stepped out into the backyard. There was no sign of a light anywhere. She listened with all her ears but could hear nothing but the night. “James!―Shawn!” she called, but nothing came from the darkness.
(1) safe and relieved	(2) relaxed and comfortable
(3) nervous and worried	(4) satisfied and pleased
(5) cold and indifferent
31. 다음 글의 빈칸 (A), (B)에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것은?
Sheets of paper exist almost entirely for the purpose of carrying information, so we tend to think of them as neutral objects. We rarely interpret marks on paper as references to the paper itself.   (A)  , when we see the text, characters, and images on artifacts that serve other purposes, we generally interpret these marks as labels that do refer to their carriers. Natural objects do not come with labels, of course, but these days, most physical artifacts do.   (B)  , their designers have chosen to shift part of the burden of communication from the form and materials of the artifact itself to lightweight surface symbols. So, for example, a designer of door handles might not worry about communicating their functions through their shapes, but might simply mark them ‘push’ and ‘pull.’

[32~33] 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.
32. Many people believe that they will be free of their anger if they express it, and that their tears will release their pain. This belief derives from a nineteenth-century understanding of emotions, and it is no truer than the flat earth. It sees the brain as a steam kettle in which negative feelings build up pressure. But no psychologist has ever succeeded in proving the unburdening effects of the supposed safety valves of tears and anger. On the contrary, over forty years ago, controlled studies showed that fits of anger are more likely to intensify anger, and that tears can drive us still deeper into depression. Our heads do not resemble steam kettles, and our brains involve a much more complicated system than can be accounted for by images taken from nineteenth-century technology.
(1) 감정에 따른 두뇌 반응의 상이성
(2) 두뇌 구조와 우울증의 관계
(3) 19세기 과학이 뇌신경학에 미친 영향
(4) 감정 표출의 효과에 대한 오해
(5) 눈물과 분노의 심리적 유사성

33. Knowing when something happened is important. Understanding why historic events took place is also important. To do this, historians often turn to geography. Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there. For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, you must look at the geography of Egypt. Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks. The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities. That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization.
(1) effects of the Nile River on Egyptian farming
(2) significance of geography in understanding history
(3) differences between geography and geology
(4) varieties of Egyptian civilization
(5) development of Egyptian culture

Nowadays, we can enjoy athletic competition of every kind without leaving our homes. It is the fun that comes from cheering on our team and celebrating its skills while complaining about the opposing team’s good luck. But some individuals sit and watch a football game or tennis match without cheering for anyone or any team. They are not willing to risk the possible disappointment of picking the loser, so they give up the possible joy of picking the winner. They live in the world of neutrality. Don’t be one of them. Sure, your team might lose. But then again, your team might win. Either way, your spectator experience will have been a fun one, and you will have avoided being merely a passive observer.
(1) 상대 팀의 승리에 찬사를 보내라.

37. sacred lotus에 관한 다음 글의 내용과 일치하지 않는 것은? 
A water plant called the sacred lotus regulates its temperature in order to benefit insects that it needs to reproduce. When the plant flowers, it heats its blossoms to above 86℉ for as long as four days. It does so, even when the air is as cool as 50℉. The heat releases an aroma that attracts certain insects, which fly into the flower to feed on nectar and pollen. But according to Roger Seymour and Paul Schultze-Motel of Australia’s University of Adelaide, the heat does more: It rewards insects with a stable environment that enhances their ability to eat, mate, and prepare for flight.

38. Old Hawk gestured up at the tall, old cottonwood. It was so large that a grown man could not put his arms around it. “This tree,” he said, “has stood guard over our family all its life. Strength is what I feel each time I look at it. Yet, there have been moments when its great strength was also its weakness.” “That’s hard to believe,” Jeremy said. “It’s the biggest tree for miles around.” Old Hawk pointed at the chokecherry trees in a dry river bed not far away. “Look there,” he said, “those chokecherry trees are small and weak in comparison to this cottonwood. But when you were a child, they survived a storm without losing a branch. This old cottonwood, on the other hand, lost several branches. It stood up to the storm, but it could not bend with the wind the way the chokecherry trees could.”

39. The specific combinations of foods in a cuisine and the ways they are prepared constitute a deep reservoir of accumulated wisdom about diet and health and place. In Latin America, for example, corn is traditionally eaten with beans; each plant is deficient in an essential amino acid that happens to be abundant in the other, so together corn and beans form a balanced diet in the absence of meat. Similarly, corn in Latin America is traditionally ground or soaked with limestone, which makes available a B vitamin in the corn, the absence of which would otherwise lead to a deficiency disease. Very often, when a society adopts a new food without the food culture surrounding it, as happened when corn first came to Europe, Africa, and Asia, people get sick. The context in which a food is eaten can be nearly as important as the food itself.

Now many kinds of superior coffee beans are being decaffeinated in ways that conserve strong flavor. But the public suffers from a groundless fear of chemical decaffeination and prefers instead to buy water-processed decaf.

(A)The solvent comes into direct contact with them, carrying the caffeine with it. The drained solvent is then mixed with water, and the caffeine is drawn out to be sold. 
(B)In the water process, however, no solvent touches the beans. After the beans are steamed, they are soaked in water, which removes the caffeine―along with all the soluble solids in the beans. The solution is drained off to a separate tank, where the caffeine is drawn out from it.
(C)Every process of decaffeination, whether chemical- or water-based, starts with steaming the green beans to loosen the bonds of caffeine. In the chemical process, a solvent circulates through the beans.

41. Processing a TV message is much more like the all-at-once processing of the ear than the linear processing of the eye reading a printed page. According to McLuhan, television is fundamentally an acoustic medium. To make this point clear, he invited people to try a simple experiment. First, turn the sound down on the TV set for one minute during your favorite program. Now, for another minute, adjust the TV set so that you can hear the sound but you can’t see any picture. Which condition was more frustrating? Which condition gave you less information? McLuhan believed that people who tried this little exercise would invariably report more frustration in the condition where the picture was visible but the sound was inaudible.

42. Most people have a vase or two in a cupboard, but lots of things can be turned into stylish containers for a flower arrangement, so before you rush out to buy anything, look around your own home. For instance, goldfish bowls look stunning filled with flower heads or petals, magnifying their contents. Wine, milk, mineral water, or olive oil bottles look particularly good with one or two stems in them. Try a collection of bottles in various shapes and sizes, lined up on a shelf or grouped on a table. An old teapot which has lost its lid becomes an ideal container for a bunch of roses picked from the garden.

In Pamplona, a white-walled, sun-baked town high up in the hills of Navarre, is held in the first two weeks of July each year the World’s Series of bull fighting. The cafes under the wide arcades that run around the Plaza de la Constitucion have every table crowded. All day and all night there is dancing in the street. Bands of blue-shirted farmers circle and lift and swing behind a drum and various wind instruments in the ancient Basque Riau-Riau dances. And at night there is the beat of the big drums and the military band as the whole town dances in the great open square of the Plaza.

One grandmother hires her grandchildren to help with gardening chores.

Whether their grandchildren have special needs or not, grandparents shouldn’t overlook the value of incidental learning experiences. ((1)) Every day, opportunities exist in the form of errands, meal preparation, and chores. ((2)) At the farmers’ market, for example, a child might discover a new meaning for the word ‘ears’ when choosing corn. ((3)) Similarly, when filling the tank at the gas station, older children can compare prices and practice estimation, asking questions such as “How much do you think it will cost to fill the tank?” ((4)) As a result, they can learn the names of flowers and understand the tools and processes involved in growing vegetables. ((5)) Activities like these also enhance the value of hard work and persistence.

Everywhere in the world, the issue of how to manage urban growth poses the highest stakes, complex policy decisions, and strongly heated conflicts in the public area. The contrast between Western Europe and America is particularly sharp. In Western Europe, steep gasoline taxes, investment policies favoring built-up areas over undeveloped greenfields, continuous investment in public transportation, and other policies have produced relatively compact cities. Cities in Western Europe tend to be economically healthy compared with their suburbs. By contrast, in the United States, cheap gas, massive highway investment, policies that favor construction on the edges of cities, and heavy reliance on property taxes to fund public schools have encouraged much more car-reliant and spread-out urban areas, where eight in ten Americans now live.

(A)One Saturday during the summer, I asked my father if he would go down to the schoolyard and play basketball with me. I had just finished the fifth grade, and wanted desperately to make the middle school team the coming fall. (a)I couldn’t believe my ears when he called for my mother and sister to come along, for, in the traditional fashion, my mother was the house accountant, the launderer, and, of course, the cook.
(B)She turned from the basket and began heading the other way. (b)“Um-mah,” I cried at her, my irritation already bubbling over, “the basket’s over here!” After a few steps she turned around, and from where the professional three-point line must be now, she effortlessly flipped the ball up in the air, its flight truer and higher than I’d witnessed from any boy or man. The ball curved cleanly into the basket, stiffly popping the chain-link net. All afternoon, she rained in shot after shot, as my father and I ran after her. 
(C)When we got home from the playground, my mother showed me the photograph album of her high school days. I was shocked to learn that she had been the top player for the national high school team that once won the all-Asia championships. (c)For years I kept it in my room, on the same shelf that housed the scrapbooks I made of basketball stars, with magazine clippings of great players such as Bubbles Hawkins, Pistol Pete, and George Gervin.
(D)When we arrived, my sister immediately ran off to the swings, and (d)I recall being annoyed that my mother wasn’t following her. I dribbled awkwardly around the free-throw line, almost losing control of the ball, and made a flat shot that bounced wildly off the basket. The ball fell to my father, who took a few not so graceful dribbles and missed an easy layup. (e)He rebounded his shot and passed the ball to my mother, who had been watching us from the foul line.
*layup: (골 근처에서 한 손으로 하는) 레이업 슛

Some scientists have shown the practical power of looking at the world through ‘could-be’eyes. When a group of students were shown an unfamiliar rubbery object and told, “This could be a dog’s chewy toy,” they were later able to see that it might also be of use as an eraser when they made some pencil mistakes. In contrast, students who were told that it was a dog’s chewy toy did not find its alternative use. 
Another group of students watched a video about physics after being told, “This presents only one of several outlooks on physics. Please feel free to use any additional methods you want to assist you in solving the problems.” On tests of factual comprehension, these students performed no differently from students who had watched the video with a different introduction: “This presents the outlook on physics. Please use the method you see in the video in solving the problems.” But when they were faced with questions that asked them to use the information more creatively, the ‘could-be’ students performed much better than the others. Just a simple            of language seemed to invite the students to process and store information in a much more flexible format, and thus be able to look at it and make use of it in different ways.
